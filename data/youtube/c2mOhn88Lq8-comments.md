### Q: Will this work on q60s as well? I’m probably going to follow this wiring guide but I’m not sure if everything lines up the same.
*Asked by @BlackOnBlackQ (1 likes)*

**A:** idk, never been in a set of 60 lights! post up and let us know!
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: I just watched this vid set from start to finish. Great vids! Have you heard of any company making a complete kit yet? 😎👍
*Asked by @LayzeLyfe (1 likes)*

**A:** I'm working with Glowe on one!!! 🙌🏾
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: @SquareWheels Automotive great vid. Have you seen the 8 output ghozt controller?
*Asked by @brucesmith007 (1 likes)*

**A:** I'm pretty sure its the exact same hardware, just with the signal split.  I say this because my "4 output" was just the same signal with 2x2 splitters

### Q: Hey man great tutorials on the headlight retrofit!! Really appreciate your time with this. I have got everything to do my headlights atm other then the lightingtrendz flow series drl kit which is supposed to be delivered this Thursday. I’m wondering what kind of glue did you use to put the projector
*Asked by @feta8939 (3 likes)*

**A:** Thx for watching! Glad to hear you're gonna give it a shot!

re: glue - I used permatex super glue (its just what we had in the kitchen drawer lol) - has held up fine so far

re: blueghozt - cant go wrong either way, but honestly i wish i would have known about the blueghozt first time round. the animations are a cool bonus but the true power of it is its ability to always be on, and respond to triggers from the car (door open, turn signals, lights on, etc).  

Also, def consider it if you think you might expand beyond just headlights/DRLs.  I didn't plan to, but I ended up adding my LED emblem, DRL turn signals, and underglow - all powered by the blueghozt - its a beast.

### Q: Anyone have a step by step video of actually doing it?
*Asked by @iiTzGyln (0 likes)*

**A:** looks like this is as close as it gets 😅
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Hi, do you have a link to the red bar a cross the engine?
*Asked by @roystervi (1 likes)*

**A:** Don't have a link but it's a Tanabe STB (Strut Tower Bar) for frame rigidity
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: can you run flow series and demon eyez at the same time?
*Asked by @vane7701 (1 likes)*

**A:** Yep theyre completely independent. The into of this video shows demon eyes on, with flow series DRLs animating 👍🏾👍🏾
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Hey brotha, the wires you used for the inputs, were they supposed to come with the blueghozt controller? Or.. I’m genuinely confused 😅
*Asked by @astroworxofficial5521 (1 likes)*

**A:** Nope usually need to bring your own trigger wires
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: How many outputs needed for the blueghost, prewired or non?
*Asked by @moktarmalik1174 (1 likes)*

**A:** I did 4 outputs, prewired, mostly because I didn't know what I was doing or what to expect.

If you order prewiring from lightingtrendz, definitely open it up and confirm everything's actually wired; they missed a connection on mine 😤🤬
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Q50 / q60 headlight are same ?
*Asked by @mrlaurobeatz (1 likes)*

**A:** Nope
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

*Asked by @chriszn6216 (1 likes)*

**A:** yep there's builders out there that'll know what to do with it!
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: All in all how much did you spend?
*Asked by @ramirez071910 (1 likes)*

**A:** How much did I spend? Idk lol. a lot went to R&D/trial and error/buying wrong parts, etc. But everything in this video can be done for around $500
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Could you use a heat gun to open it to? Or does it have to be the oven
*Asked by @mczedsu7013 (0 likes)*

**A:** Probably a million ways to warm up the sealant, I just know what worked for me 🤘🤓
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: so on the ln 1 wire for the blueghozzt controller, if im using that as a 12v switch, what do i connect the converter to?.. confusing straight to the battery?
*Asked by @aceblund3134 (0 likes)*

**A:** What converter? DM me on IG!
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: But this is for your 2015 and NOT for my 2021 Q50 correct?
*Asked by @MariahMorgan11 (0 likes)*

**A:** Believe the headlights have stayed the same through the entire lineup
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Hey where can I have the panel that goes behind the projector crystal?
*Asked by @juanquessep2506 (0 likes)*

**A:** You mean the etched lenses overlay? Check my site!
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Did you need the 5v or 12v controller?
*Asked by @Elvis_Kunda (1 likes)*

**A:** Get the controller that matches the voltage of whatever strips you have. For this video I had 5v strips in.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Will connecting both ring terminal to the positive and negative on the battery instead of a ground run it out faster? My 12v-5v converter came with a very short ground wire
*Asked by @cambeezytv4850 (0 likes)*

**A:** @cambeezytv4850 dont understand the question here
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Does this kit that I order from you, have sequential drl?
*Asked by @daviddaria9250 (1 likes)*

**A:** Yep.  The answer to both your questions is "in the controller's app."   Check out my 101 video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxI-bvZGfLI

If you're using my kit, the demon eyes animate along with the rest of the components unless you/your builder set them up on separate channels.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: U never get moisture in your headlights??
*Asked by @nevergiveup2365 (1 likes)*

**A:** Nope
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: What brand was the drl or was that oem?
*Asked by @arellano7103 (1 likes)*

**A:** Originally lightingtrendz but I've upgraded to Glowe: https://www.instagram.com/reel/CilzEnFj67u/
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Do you always have to go in app to turn these on and off ? Or it turns offs when you turn the car off ? Lastly does the demon eyes shows when in auto mode ?
*Asked by @youngsuavekiddd1 (1 likes)*

**A:** Nope, they completely respond to inputs and switched power from the vehicle.  Once I've got it configured, I rarely go into the app unless I want to set a show mode.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Hey broz me again, I'm on day 3 working on the headlights lol. So we FINALLY got everything wired and connected. Only concern is that the demon eyes and the lash (the lights to the right of the demon eyes) does not turn off by itself when the car is on and locked. I have to do it in the app. Is this
*Asked by @joseostorva7235 (1 likes)*

**A:** I e got the demon eyes getting power off one of my Blueghozt Plus outputs, set to triggered. So it only turns on when the DRLs are on.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: I heard vinyl on lens isn’t proper way and etching is better and more accurate way to do it. I c you used vinyl overlay on lens how did this last?
*Asked by @gurjotdhaliwal7337 (0 likes)*

**A:** Going on 3 years on my Q, had vinyl on the lenses of my G for 6yrs before I sold it.  If we’re just trying to make semitransparent patterns on our lenses, what does “better and more accurate” actually mean? 🤷🏾‍♂️
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*
