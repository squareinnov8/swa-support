## Questions Answered by SquareWheels

### Q: An excellent overview of the AUCar Mark 5. Thanks for your great work on this and the installation Video.
Do you know of any features this unit has, that the Pheonix Mark 3 doesn't have or vice-versa?
*Asked by @NedBing (3 likes)*

**A:** These are very similar units, capable of running the same software. The biggest differences would be the resolved glitches (airbag light, steering wheel controls, stuff like that), custom hard button, and the easier install (don't need to hack your steering column) on the AUCar

### Q: I’m buying my first Q 50 I just had my G37 S totaled by a text driver. I love your tips! This is amazingly beautiful 🤩 

Did you highlight the lights you have on your floors? This feature is sick! Thank you 🙏🏻 in advance
*Asked by @macrocoachkellimichelle (4 likes)*

**A:** Aaaye welcome to the Q fam Kelli, I had a G37s too!

The footwell lighting is just a cheap kit off Amazon: https://amzn.to/3Bgynth I have them wired to turn on when the doors open. Check out my illuminated kickplate video, they're wired to the same circuit.

Thx for the support, be sure to sub I've got more coming!!

### Q: Thank you for the quality content, as always! Do you happen to know if the unit is rooted, or easily rootable? The price on the unit is very compelling, I do wish you the best with the channel's growth, as you seriously put a lot of time and effort into your content.
*Asked by @kaioshine (5 likes)*

**A:** Thx for the support!!! Unfortunately idk about rooting these things... The OS is pretty unrestricted as-is, what would u be looking to accomplish by rooting?
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Hey man! Great video, have you done any tests regarding security of the device? Like any network packet capture to see if it sends any sensitive data to an unknown server?
*Asked by @holyship9914 (3 likes)*

**A:** Nope! Happy to try if you point me in the right direction, would be interesting to see.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Thanks for the informative video! 
Would you be able to acquire a iPhone and use it with the unit in a video? I want to purchase one, but I’d like to see how it works with the iPhone platform since that is what I use. 
Thank you and great video!!
*Asked by @Ruehlbacca (2 likes)*

**A:** Hey - I don't have an iPhone but there's several videos of MK5 users showcasing Carplay in this group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/InfinitiAV
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Hey great videos man, gonna sub! Question: Audio, can’t see any comments on this. I’m assuming the MK5 acts only as an audio source and not amplification? My 350z BOSE audio was instantly ripped out but with the BOSE premium in my Q60 the audio is like pretty decent. So I’m conscious to avoid downgr
*Asked by @dirtydogbox (1 likes)*

**A:** Thx for the support Wasso!!! So consider the MK5 a source that you'd plug into your aux port, like a phone or mp3 player. That's exactly how it behaves, it piggybacks the AUX. If you have Bose, all the amplifying and sound processing will still be handled downstream.  The MK5 has its own EQ but I leave flat and just let the Bose do it's thing.  Hope that helps!!

### Q: Where can I get the harness, well basically all the cables for a Mark 5? They got lost while moving...

**A:** Got your support email but responding here too - spare cable kits will be available on SquareWheelsAuto.com soon

### Q: Hey I installed mine yesterday. I don’t see a setting for the heated seats or steering wheel. Do you know how I can get those to function?
*Asked by @JuanHernandez-ep7cl (1 likes)*

**A:** Intouch climate control settings.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Love the tutorial just pre ordered the MK6! I was confused on the hotspot portion, does this mean the screen can’t run apps that require wifi such as spotify, waze etc.. without having the hotspot on? Is there any way around that just needs some clarification thanks and great showcase!
*Asked by @cursedpvp9946 (1 likes)*

**A:** These are full Android devices and thus are most useful when you feed them internet. Without internet, it'll run the apps, but if they have functiinality that requires internet, that functionality won't work (Spotify and Google maps have offline mode, I do t think Waze does).  

If you don't want to go the hotspot route, the MK6 comes with a sim port so you can give it a dedicated 4g data plan 😈

*Asked by @justinparzychowskijr3799 (2 likes)*

*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: I am seriously considering buying one of these for my Q50, looks awesome and relatively easy to install.  One question, my cell phone plan doesn't support hot spot so can I hard wire my phone to the screen for Waze and Spotify use while driving?  Thanks!
*Asked by @PMODinc (1 likes)*

**A:** Yep the units support wired and wireless carplay I'd you have an iPhone, as well as wired Android auto 👍🏾👍🏾
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Happy Thanksgiving - much thanks & appreciation to you for the time/effort(aka work) you put forth to help us (Infiniti Qommunity) w/all needed info from top to bottom using these Tesla style screens. The question I have for you is, are you familiar with the "Cidava" or "Autotecpro" screens for the 
*Asked by @alexobmann9329 (2 likes)*

**A:** I'm pretty sure they're all exactly the same hardware AND software, offered and supported by different resellers.  

With that understanding, you can probably let price and prepurchase and postpurchase support guide your decisions. Happy hunting!!
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Do you know if you have to use the USB extensions out of the back of the unit for Android Auto, or should you be able to use the armrest receptacle after piggybacking that wire harness into the unit? 

Also, I have an idle message pop up periodically if I have a YouTube video on, have you experience
*Asked by @colton88ify (3 likes)*

**A:** I use the armrest for Android auto

Never got an idle message, but I have YouTube and Spotify premium, not sure if that makes a difference?

*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Has this messed with the car? Ik Nissan products tend to be picky with their electrical?
*Asked by @xyrofyro8982 (1 likes)*

**A:** Almost a year now, no issues.  You can consider this 'lipstick on a pig' - it just sits on top and looks pretty, but doesn't really mess with too much of the inner-workings.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Are the back up lines the same as the stock back up camera ? I noticed in video it only had the yellow line but not the red and orange ones
*Asked by @Qfifty (1 likes)*

**A:** Pretty sure there's a setting to choose the OEM or aftermarket backup lines. Can't recall if it comes that way, or the Sergey firmware added it.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Ok newbie question but has anyone experienced the issue with the back up sensors not work and my air bag light staying on in the unit? I followed the instillation video you posted but something isn’t right?!
*Asked by @babyjes117 (1 likes)*

**A:** Yeah the little airbag light stays on on mine too - I think that's normal.
When you say the back up sensors don't work, what do you mean exactly?  If you ordered through squarewheelsauto, don't hesitate to open up a support ticket on the site, or just shoot me an email at support@squarewheelsauto.com
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Hey Rob ! Sorry For the constant comments on videos …. Again I’m really loving the unit and the firmware update. What I think I ran into was the wrong car audio company because I’m finding little faults in their installation and they make it seem like it’s a very complicated and expensive fix. I was

### Q: Hey nice videos man i love your car! I have a 2019 Q50 2.2d and i live in Germany. Can i just buy the screen on your website and replace it easily? Does it work with android phones aswell without problems?
*Asked by @sueno4671 (1 likes)*

**A:** Yep. Check my channel for the installation video. Most people get it done in less than an hour 👍🏾👍🏾

Works well with Android, I use it daily with my Samsung S21 as a hotspot.

### Q: I have an iPhone does this have car play? And with the car play I get get all the apps just like my iPhone ?
*Asked by @astonishhyjack1621 (1 likes)*

**A:** Yes wired and wireless CarPlay. So it’ll show all your apps that are CarPlay compatible.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Can you connect an iPhone to the screen via Bluetooth?
*Asked by @tazzliltaz7164 (1 likes)*

**A:** Yes of course.  You can connect your iPhone for bluetooth streaming and calls, or you can use wired/wireless carplay and convert the screen to an extension of your phone.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Question so do I have to send a picture of the dashboard and so with car play with my iPhone I can see apps like I music Waze etc and still have access to the extra features like Netflix hulu all in one ?
*Asked by @janncymariserla7345 (1 likes)*

**A:** I don't think they need to see your dash as long as you pick the right year/trim when you order. 

Yeah all the Carplay stuff works. Check out https://youtu.be/q_krcJmG4Fo

### Q: Bro how tall are you? Just curious as I'm looking at this car
*Asked by @bvnger (1 likes)*

**A:** 6' - but don't use my videos to judge space, I use a wide angle lens so viewers can see more in the frame, but it distorts things and makes me look like I'm cramped against the wheel 😅😅
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Do you have to have the microphone that comes with unit to use Siri or voice commands for it ?
*Asked by @Qfifty (1 likes)*

**A:** Nope voice commands work great using OEM mics. I tossed the mic that came with it 👍🏾👍🏾
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Thank you for the great videos. I'm probably going to wait a few months for the Mark 6. Have a 2020 Q60 RS with Bose. If I want to keep using the factory amp, is it possible to connect to it with the pre amp outputs? Is it even compatible with the factory Bose system?
*Asked by @GeddyBear (0 likes)*

**A:** Thx for watching Jamil! Yah im looking fwd to the next gen too. Ive got Bose also - I skip the preamps and just send the audio signals thru aux to the Bose processors. Sounds as good as stock. There's also fine tuning in the unit with a (16 band I think?) equalizer.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Awesome video. I'm considering getting this unit for my Q50S. I also like your foot well lighting. How is it wired? Are all the wires completely hidden?
*Asked by @R.London (1 likes)*

**A:** Thanks! They're actually cheapo LEDs off Amazon (https://amzn.to/3dIv0BV). I insist on stealthy wiring whenever possible. I wired it to the dome lights, so they turn on when the doors open, or I hit the dome light button. Used this same circuit: https://youtu.be/8R3xZDizw3I

### Q: What’s up? Does the little control knob down by the shifter do anything?

*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Would I be able to watch HBO Max and Youtube on these? I understand that its a full tablet with android as an OS. So I know the apps can be downloaded, but how do you get sound from the unit to play through the car speakers?
*Asked by @AddictusSaevire (1 likes)*

**A:** Yes HBO max and YouTube work like any other app.  I use Youtube, Netflix, and YoutubeTV  pretty often.  

All the sound goes through the aux channel of your car.  Part of the installation is a T-harness that hijacks the signal.

### Q: Hey, great vid!!!!! I just got a 2018 Sport and can’t wait to get modding. I don’t plan on tackling the Tesla screen till the spring. Do you think a new version will be out by then?
*Asked by @cliffordraymond9123 (1 likes)*

**A:** Thanks, and congrats on the new Q!! I know for a fact there's a new version coming (I've recently gotten sneak peeks of the new interfaces), the question of the year is WHEN!!  It was supposed to be released for customers by now, but COVID, supply chain, etc etc issues have things delayed and up in the air.  Stay tuned, when the prototype is ready for testing, I'll be covering it here.

Enjoy that Q!!

### Q: Do they have the 2022 compatible model for the Infiniti Q50 sensory edition 300hp twin turbo?
*Asked by @egymartinez34 (1 likes)*

**A:** There's confirmed support up to 2021 models. If nothing's changed on the 2022 infotainment/wiring, the same units should work. They'd need to see the back if your top screen to be sure.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Dumb question probably. But I’m an Apple girl, with a 2017 Q50. I got one that didn’t have the heated seats or navigation. Would this still work for me if I have an iPhone? And who would put this in for me. I’m ignorant to the process. Your answer will definitely help me
*Asked by @duchesselizabethlindsey (1 likes)*

**A:** Not dumb, probably the most common question I get. Gonna post a video soon to address it.  

But yes it definitely works with an iPhone. U can either feed it internet by setting your iphone as a hotspot, or use Carplay wired or wirelessly.

Installation is pretty easy, u can do it in less than an hour with just a screwdriver. I broke the install down here: https://youtu.be/Imqw7oa3izE

If ur not comfortable doing it yourself, I bet any custom audio shop will do it for you.

Thx for watching! Lmk if u have any other questions 👍🏾

### Q: I recently  just got mine installed  but for some reason the numbers  for the temperature  doesnt go any lower that 89 degrees,  any suggestions  on how to get that fixed? & the sounds  doesn't work on any app like Spotify or YouTube, it only works with the  original music  player
*Asked by @marlonrivas3317 (1 likes)*

**A:** If your temp starts or sticks at 89, try hitting hit temp UP a couple times instead of down, and it should look around to 60.

I've never heard anyone report that audio issue 🤔 reach out to Aucar support - they are very responsive and get u sorted out one way or another!
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Can't you put a faster device in there? It is clearly very slow, even if you bump up the price, I think many people would gladly pay more for faster response

### Q: Would u say this is more responsive than the factory screen, if all I will be doing on it is going to Apple CarPlay is it still worth it?
*Asked by @crabbiestwand2151 (1 likes)*

**A:** More responsive than factory screen: YES, infinitely - especially in CarPlay mode
Using as only CarPlay: debatably worth it.  Its definitely worth it when used as a full android tablet.  Maybe worth it if you factor in (and like) the change it has on the interior.

### Q: Can you play video while driving on this unit. I like the tesla screen style, but is on the fence, since it require a Hotspot to run the unit. I was also looking at the smartauto kit and saw your video showing how I can play video while driving which is what I want. Seeing that you have experience w
*Asked by @luckyphixaysavath4336 (1 likes)*

**A:** Yeah it can do video while driving also (downloaded videos like the smartautokits, as well as Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, whatever) 

I like the Tesla screen better for 2 reasons:
1) it looks awesome in comparison
2) no wires, nothing to plug in when I drive. It just works.

It also does a lot more than the Smartautokits unit. It's essentially an Android tablet so it can run any app.

Hope this helps!!!
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: How does this work with audio quality. Any noticeable difference?
*Asked by @PeacefulChaosSound (1 likes)*

**A:** Nope sounds good to me. It just sends audio through the Bose amp like any other input, and there's a 16 band equalizer for fine tuning.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Does this unit use the bose amps, or do I lose that?

### Q: But where do the factory gps attena goes? Cant find no connector that takes the blue part
*Asked by @tnaz22orange (0 likes)*

**A:** The unit comes with an aftermarket GPS antenna. It's the puck. If you want to use your factory GPS antenna, you'd have to get an adapter. I don't have factory GPS so I am not sure the exact adapter you need.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Did you have to uninstall the piggypacked motherboard from the screen (Have a Joyeauto and had to take the screen apart. How is the call quality? Had call issues using the carplay kit and was running it through BT q50 audio. How has this one compared??

### Q: How quickly does the screen boot up when starting the car?  Can you show our talk about how to put in split screen? Can you change the color of the physical buttons?  How good is the GPS signal?
Thank you
*Asked by @darnellhoward660 (1 likes)*

**A:** It's fast boot, so if you've started the car in the last 24 hrs, its pretty quick... seconds. Longer than that, it does a full reboot and takes ~20 seconds to be usable.

Apps that can be split screened have indicators in the bottom left corner that allow you to toggle split screen mode, and switch position (top/bottom)

There's an app called colors that allows you to change the backlight on the physical buttons including the HVAC controls on the side.

GPS signal is great, no issues. If u use the included puck, be sure to position it with a view of the sky. If ur Q has factory nav, you can use your factory gps antenna if u buy an adapter.

### Q: Love the video!  I've been contemplating on getting this type of screen on my Q. I do have 1 question though, does it work only with the OEM back up camera or can it work with an aftermarket one as well? My biggest peeve on my Q is the quality of the camera (I have a 2014 model, only have the rear c
*Asked by @johnpascual7910 (1 likes)*

**A:** Good question, I hear you on the camera quality lol. This screen is high definition, so it'll actually make your stock camera look worse, because it's stretching the low resolution image out wider.

### Q: Hello! I seen where some Mark 5 will display an “airbag warning” have you had that issue and also can I play music from iPhone through bluetooth? Thanks in advance.
*Asked by @pennyvision9530 (1 likes)*

**A:** Haven't heard it described as an issue 😅  I'm pretty sure there's an airbag light on the OEM screens too, I just can't remember.

The light  shows up to indicate the passenger airbag is disabled.   When there's a butt in the passenger seat, it turns off 👍🏾

Yes Bluetooth audio from iPhone is supported
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: hey, couple questions for you. Are you able to use wired carplay with the factory usb’s in the center console? If so what app in the unit would you need to use in order to enable it?.
Second question, what app within the unit would allow you to use wired carplay?
*Asked by @sevensynycal (0 likes)*

**A:** 1) I've heard mixed results from those who have tried using the factory USB plugs.  The unit definitely includes its own USB ports and I know for a fact CarPlay works with those.  
2) The unit comes with Zlink preinstalled.  That's the app for wired or wireless Carplay.  I showcase it here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_krcJmG4Fo

**A:** Nah but I didn't use the subwoofer out from the MK5. I just tapped the Bose subwoofer signal like in my other video.  If you use the MK5s subwoofer out, you might need to use the equalizer in settings to control the sub's output??

### Q: Does it show the camera that is on the mirrors?
*Asked by @alejandrobaltao1108 (0 likes)*

**A:** Yup 360 camera support ✅
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Couple questions: if I have a luxe w/360 camera is that supported? Looks like the drop down only specified red sport w/360. Is the CarPlay organic to that unit, or did your car previously need CarPlay for this unit to piggy back on?
*Asked by @jacobchildress7457 (2 likes)*

**A:** Lux w 360, you'll want the American LHD. All supported including 360 cameras and sonar. Carplay comes with the unit and works both wired and wirelessly. 👍🏾

### Q: Does the navigation need a hotspot? Where I live, the internet isn't that great.
*Asked by @jarrelshotya2573 (1 likes)*

**A:** Google navigation allows you to download maps of your local area so you can navigate without an internet connection. You'll miss out on all the live notifications/traffic rerouting/etc but it'd work.

### Q: Have you run into any problems since uploading the video? Was thinking about getting it, but im a little perturbed that the problems I've been seeing with the mk3 might happen with this.
*Asked by @halobanana99 (1 likes)*

**A:** I only uploaded 3 days ago but it has been consistently stable for the ~1.5 weeks I've owned it - that's all I can go by! I've seen many reports of those MK3 issues too, and generally the issues dont "pop up" over time, they're messed up right outta the box

### Q: I have a 17 red sport do I need a specific unit for 360 cameras to work or are all q50 units equipped with the option?

### Q: Sir, I messed up my q50 screen by deleting some of the apps or software! So I’m thinking to buy this unit instead of fix the one comes with my q since this one is a lot better! So do u think this one would work right away? Even if my oem screen is not working great right now. Please answer my questi
*Asked by @alialghanim1377 (1 likes)*

**A:** It really depends on how bad you messed up the Q50 screen.  This unit is an android tablet and thus has tons of functionality that will probably/definitely work well independently - but any functions that require communication with the vehicle (example, climate control, intouch menus, etc etc) are at risk - if they're screwed up, there's nothing the screen can do to help.  

If it was me, I'd get one and give it a shot! I've heard having the dealer replace screens (or even just reloading apps) is super expensive.

### Q: Appreciate you homie, 2 questions? What is the purpose of the mark 5 speaker and how did you run your microphone speaker line or better yet where did you end up installing it? Thanks Godspeed
*Asked by @tricksta213lag5 (1 likes)*

**A:** I honestly have no idea what the speaker is for. I didn't install it, and I haven't noticed any purpose for it.

I ran the microphone out the driver side, just above the leather trim on the center console. I've seen some other people run it up the a pillar so it's closer to the drivers mouth, but that makes the voice assistant/bluetooth mic less accessible for my passengers.

### Q: are you able to hook an aftermarket sub and amp to this unit? im about to order one (with your code) but I want to know if this is possible in the future
*Asked by @ethanboi808 (1 likes)*

**A:** Yep for sure. I have a sub and amp hooked up (check out my DIY video when you're ready). It sends out audio thru the factory system so you're good there.

ADDITIONALLY this unit comes with preamp outputs for all channels (FR, FL, RR, RL, and SUB) in case you want to go crazy.

### Q: I installed my last night and my camera oem is so bad why?? And I don’t have the 3ft lines
*Asked by @adrianstypulkowski4266 (0 likes)*

**A:** So the backup camera video will look worse because i's a low-resolution OEM camera signal, and its now displaying on a high-resolution screen.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: This is probably a very stupid question but would this be worth purchasing if you own an Iphone? I assume a lot of the functionality and benefits of the unit would not work with an Iphone? The next question would be are their any units that work hand in hand with Iphone?
*Asked by @Dreamevil2009 (1 likes)*

**A:** Not stupid at all.  These are android devices, but they fully support and integrate with iphones.  There's full Carplay support, both wired and wireless.

### Q: Does the Mark 5 support screen mirroring on Android?
*Asked by @seanohara9491 (0 likes)*

**A:** Yup for sure.  Its essentially an android tablet so you'd just need to install an app from the play store that does it.  Easycon is an example of an app that does mirroring both wired and wirelessly.
