### Q: Quick question, In order to use apple carplay do i need to have my hotspot on or can i turn my hotspot off and use bluetooth only for wireless car play? you mentioned it in the video but im still a little confused.
*Asked by @pizzy7630 (3 likes)*

**A:** One or the other sir. If you use carplay, kill the hotspot and vice versa 👍🏾👍🏾

### Q: Looks dope man. question I have is, messages and calls, apple maps all work correctly with iphone? Also, the HVAC… for steering wheel heating & the seats, all still fully functional?
*Asked by @BehindMyVisor (1 likes)*

**A:** Messages, calls, maps all work.  This is just a pretty frontend for CarPlay, so it'll behave like any other CarPlay device.

All the HVAC/heated seats etc work fine.  I don't have heated steering wheel on my Q, but I haven't heard anyone complain or report it not working for them.

The only 2 things that don't work on mine are: 
1) call button on the steering wheel doesn't map to anything, and 
2) the voice command button maps to a weird voice app that I uninstalled

### Q: I have been thinking seriously about the system for a few months, but have heard mixed reviews. Has there been any recent firmware updates that clean up the user interface?
*Asked by @thomasturner5742 (2 likes)*

**A:** Nope. If the UI bugs you, know that you can run ANY Android launcher on these things that allow you lots of flexibility and theming. Nova launcher and Car launcher pro are 2 great options I tried.

There's also the Sergey firmware which takes these things to another level with themes that incorporate telemetry from the vehicle (compass, speed and Ron meeters, etc)

### Q: I have a mark6 and when I click on the car audio nothing happens, doesn’t go to the next screen. Do you know how I can reset my unit ?
*Asked by @invoicedkey7397 (1 likes)*

### Q: can i connect this to ECUTEK?
*Asked by @UF0_1 (1 likes)*

*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Can you watch Netflix on it or YouTube?
*Asked by @andrewmazo6443 (1 likes)*

**A:** You bet.  The device comes with Netflix and Youtube Apps installed.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Can you keep/delete certain apps from the car screen?
*Asked by @killumashotti (1 likes)*

**A:** Yep. That's a native feature of CarPlay.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Just installed the screen and the fitment where the screen meets the top of the dashboard won’t lineup, I’ve tried for a while now but it just doesn’t. Any idea how to line it up ?
*Asked by @tylerbryk3398 (1 likes)*

**A:** Yeah I've seen this before.  Tough to explain in words, but your top screen (behind the MK5) isn't seated properly.  Make sure it is properly seated before screwing it back in, then the MK5 will sit flush.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Once you initially wirelessly connect your iPhone to the unit, does it automatically connect as soon as you turn the car on? Or do you have to connect it each time you start it up?
*Asked by @just_wes_99 (1 likes)*

**A:** Automatically connects once you open the Car Auto app on the MK5. And you can set the Car Auto app to automatically run when the car starts 👍🏾

### Q: Netflix or you tube on Apple CarPlay mode?
*Asked by @salweirdz2161 (0 likes)*

### Q: Just got mine installed I few days ago.  Everything seems to work fine except the lights on the unit keep changing.  Is there a way to make the unit stick with 1 color?

### Q: how does the mk5 stack up against the smartautokits CarPlay mod? Which unit is smoother and/or has the lowest latency? strictly regarding iPhone CarPlay compatibility.
*Asked by @edwardgutierrez5705 (1 likes)*

**A:** As far as CarPlay goes, I found latency negligible
on both.  As far as I know, Carplay/Android Auto don't really rely on the unit's processing power too much. They're just terminals and the phone is the host.

### Q: Brother,  I have installed several Android based CarPlay systems on the Q40, G37, Q60 and now on my Q50.  The one on the Q50 is not integrated like the previous cars (using a dongle with a small Android tablet).  My issue with all of them (though Grom Audio  fixed the issue on my Q40 and G37) while 
*Asked by @deborinquen13 (2 likes)*

**A:** Hey Luis - that sounds infuriating haha.  I haven't experienced any echo or delays on calls using wireless CarPlay, and haven't heard any reports of it with the MK5.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: My Apple Music seams to skip when I’m connected to CarPlay, any suggestions why this is?
*Asked by @alexisirizarry279 (0 likes)*

**A:** Why this is: 
As there are constant evolutions in hosts (iphones and their software versions) and clients (like OEM carplay setups, or the MK5 like I demoed in this video), incompatibilities & glitches are bound to pop up.

*Asked by @mgeraci07 (1 likes)*

**A:** Interesting question.  I tried getting to this menu and it didn't work.  Worst case scenario, you'd need to connect the original screen to run diags.  I'll ask around to see if anyone's found another way to get in.   Thanks!!
