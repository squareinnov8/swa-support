### Introduction ([0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUAs0IwxbEc&t=0s))

If you're into Infinity Q50s and you follow car builds on Instagram, check me out. It's VQ50 on Instagram. All right, let's get to the video. So, frequently on Instagram and on YouTube, whenever I happen to feature my top screen showing video, I get a lot of questions around how do you do that? How'd you get that to happen? So, in this video, I'm going to let the cat out of the bag and show you which product I'm using to make it happen. Make sure you stick around till the end cuz at the end of this video, I will share the secret menu that's included with this product that enables video while driving. Sit tight. So, if you're seeing this video and you're anything like me, you probably find the two screen infotainment system in the Q50 a bit subpar, especially when you compare it to other, you know, entry-level luxury vehicles. The two screens, they aren't even the same resolution, and the top screen doesn't really offer any functionality outside of a clock. like you might get the the title if you're playing Bluetooth audio, but other than that, it's it's basically useless.

Of course, check the link in the description below. I linked you right to it so you know exactly which product to get. All right, so from the factory, this unit will have video while driving disabled. to enable it. In the main menu, you'll click settings factory and type 1 630 and hit the check mark and that will take you to the secret menu. In that secret menu, there's an option called video driving or driving video. You want that set to on and that will enable the video to continue playing after you put the vehicle in drive. That's pretty much it, y'all. So, I love this mod. But I love this unit by Smart Auto Kits. If you're considering it, don't hesitate. Just go out and get it.
