### Introduction ([0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeBXGAO3NTs&t=0s))

[Music] so oh ah all right driving around today just got

### Installation ([1:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeBXGAO3NTs&t=110s))

the new exhaust installed the nvidia gemini catback and what i decided to do today is just to record some audio clips of how it sounds just in different conditions i'm going to talk you through the conditions as i am experiencing them so i just pulled out of a parking lot from getting set up we've got all the windows closed and i'll shut up and let you hear so at idle you barely hear anything at all i really love that about this exhaust um when you want it to be subtle and understated it's perfectly capable of doing that but when you get on it you you really know that you're getting on around 60 miles an hour nice little flip on the downshift riding out fourth get a little gear god that sounds good a little blip power god damn it sounds good no rasp anywhere on the power band like that's just vq music right there all right mercy that sounds good all right gonna give it a little turnaround here i hope you guys can see what this sounds like should be going this hard on residential roads but it's mexico what are you gonna do this is right now fourth gear at around 60 miles an hour let's hear the tires more than the engine right now all right so i finally found a location where i could pull over

### Camera Setup ([5:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeBXGAO3NTs&t=327s))

and set up my camera to do some clips to see how the car sounds uh outside the cabin so i was literally only out here for like five minutes and within that five minutes a cop had already pulled up to figure out what was going on with this camera on the side of the road but i mean this shows how awesome the exhaust is right it's loud enough to sound great when you're getting on it but yet it's quiet enough that in the event i need to pull up behind say a police officer to explain to him why there's a camera on the side of the road i can pull up quietly enough that it's not attracting any attention to my exhaust that's not going to have him asking any questions about whether there's any illegal car you know violating um things on there so we could just you know stand by and have a friendly conversation about how a 40 year old was just randomly recording videos of his car driving by this cop was cool maybe one day he'll be a subscriber all right back to more clips all right y'all that's pretty much it i absolutely love this nvidia gemini catback exhaust i hope you found this video helpful if you did please consider liking and subscribing thanks i just farted i [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] hate this thing man so sick of this you
