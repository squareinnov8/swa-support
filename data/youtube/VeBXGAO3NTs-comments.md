### Q: Love the video, thank you! Got a Q50 Red Sport last month and have decided to get the same exhaust, so fired up! Man, how are you watching a movie?!  Very interested in doing the same for the kiddos.
*Asked by @wolfpack9695 (4 likes)*

**A:** Enjoy! Keep in mind these clips are from a 3.7 Q50, if you've got a red sport it'll sound different!

### Q: Awesome video. i appreciate the effort put into it and how many different angles and pulls you did to show off the exhaust. have you found any droning while on the highways or anything?
*Asked by @ethankennedy331 (1 likes)*

**A:** I don't have this setup anymore but it was literally perfect under all conditions.  Limited drone, limited rasp, nice healthy but quiet idle, signature vq growl when you get on it.  I love my rearmount, but I miss the smooth VQ sound this exhaust made.

### Q: Dope💪🏽. What color is the front emblem?
*Asked by @dinky19810 (1 likes)*

**A:** pretty sure it was matte black when I shot this

### Q: Love the wheels ! What are they ?
*Asked by @nickskolsky2560 (2 likes)*

**A:** Thx! Theyre STR 908
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Sounds great! Do you know if they have them for the G37 sedan AWD?
*Asked by @thatlakid3780 (1 likes)*

**A:** Thx! 

Probably! They made them for G35 sedan, and I have one on my Q50 sedan, so it'd be weird for them to have skipped the G37 sedan

I had one on my G37 coupe too.

### Q: Just picked up one yesterday :) How'd you get the screen to play like that?

### Q: Look great man, what did you use to black out the grill/emblem?
*Asked by @cutlerbarrett5767 (1 likes)*

**A:** Thanks! I hit everything with primer then laid down some matte black paint
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: How did the exhaust system sound with no high flow cats and just the Invidia alone?
*Asked by @Michael98767 (2 likes)*

**A:** Got the HFCs first "unfortunately". With stock cats it'd be a lil quieter and less "throaty" probably. HFCs definitely add some growl.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: What are those rims 😍?
*Asked by @lesonc3854 (2 likes)*

**A:** STR 908 in Satin Black 🙏🏽🙏🏽
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Do you have the link for your high flow cats? I want to run this setup! I’m finally picking up my AWD Q50
*Asked by @Bryanb58 (1 likes)*

**A:** I don't!! I got mine secondhand off the forums - I'd recommend looking for lightly used since availability for new is SCARCE and prices are through the roof.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Did you add any mods to the front exterior of your q50?
*Asked by @Kevin-de3qc (1 likes)*

**A:** Not much up front. Chrome delete, blacked out the grill and added an led emblem. And I made the lower part of the bumper black to follow the lines of the grille.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: So I have isr test pipes do you think this exhaust would be the best choice or if not what one would be ?
*Asked by @ericsnyder3624 (1 likes)*

**A:** Yeah im not familiar with the ISRs but generally if you've got test pipes they make the car a bit louder and raspier.  If you're looking for a refined sounding exhaust to pair with them I'd go with either this one or the SPEEDCULTURESTUDIOS exhaust.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Does this exhaust bring up any check engine or other lights on the dash ?
*Asked by @Keypesos (1 likes)*

**A:** No. I'm no pro, but I don't think any cutback exhaust would cause that.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Is there any drone at all with this system? I went the custom route and have hated life I can't get mine to stop droning at 2.5k - 3.2k rpms so im looking for something different
*Asked by @daltonmohr9327 (1 likes)*

**A:** No drone on mine. I had the same setup on my G and it was same. Nice tones, no drone.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Sounds great! Is the exhaust the only thing you’ve done to have it sound that good?
*Asked by @soolpa6861 (3 likes)*

**A:** Thx! Sounds made possible by Kinetix High Flow Cats + the Invidia catback exhaust 🙌
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: So you have HFCs right?
*Asked by @ry4nbayani (1 likes)*

**A:** Correct
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: did you change the tips from the burnt ones it originally comes with?
*Asked by @FreshieGT (0 likes)*

*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: What's your favorite exhaust for a VQ??
*Asked by @SquareWheelsAuto (1 likes)*

**A:** @supremo718 ain't mad at that combo 😎
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Does this add any performance gains? And did you also have a tune with this or you just added the HFC and exhaust?
*Asked by @skidsrobot (0 likes)*

**A:** Feels a bit more responsive on butt-dyno, but could be placebo effect.  Planning on getting a tune eventually, just haven't gotten around to it! 😎
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Hey man I got one just recently is it normal for it to make the tsss sound when reving/accelerating with air intakes?

**A:** Yep there's an audible hiss sometimes. I can't make it happen consistently, but definitely happens.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: So all you have installed is the exhaust? Nothing else?
*Asked by @davidruffin6736 (0 likes)*

**A:** At the time of this video, stock intake, Kinetix HFC + Invidia Gemini catback
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Is the Mid pipe and Y pipe stock in this video?
*Asked by @jayyy3507 (1 likes)*

**A:** No the invidia Gemini is a full catback. So aftermarket from the cats back

### Q: is the soud of Invidia Gemini exhaust for q50 3.7 same the soud of Invidia Gemini exhaust for infiniti FX37 or Qx70  3.7 v6 ??
*Asked by @mohdsaleh218 (1 likes)*

**A:** Probably really similar since the engines are essentially the same engines.  I had the same exhaust on my G and it sounded a tiny bit throatier than my Q
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Had one o my g37x coupe.  Definitely need a Gemini on my q60rs. Too quite.  Not looking for obnoxiously loud this is a good middle ground. Did you turn off the fake exhaust sound in the cabin in secret menu?
*Asked by @metaldetectingthenortheast1294 (1 likes)*

**A:** Agreed 1000% - had the Gemini on my G37 coupe too!! 

RE: fake exhaust - my Q didn't have that "feature" 😅
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

*Asked by @StylesBlender (0 likes)*

**A:** w/kinetix HFC
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: So I have a 3.7 w/Motordyne HFC. Do you think it'll sounds super nice with the Invidia?

*— @SquareWheelsAuto*
