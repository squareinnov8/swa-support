### Q: Hello! Does anyone have problems with the sound when receiving calls when the radio is playing through the in touch system? The equalizer doesn't seem to work for me either.
*Asked by @Lockley2010 (1 likes)*

**A:** FYI you just mentioned a handful of things that actually aren't related to each other during a phone call.

### Q: My Mark 6 for my Infiniti 2020 Q50 is working fine with the exception of there is still no sound or volume when I play through the Android side of the Mark 6. When I play music through my AM, FM or XM Radio it plays fine.  When I play a YouTube video it plays fine but without music or sound. When I

### Q: Hey Squarewheels, love your content. I just wanted to if I could still get navigation in the MRK 6 if my car doesn't have it? If so how does the hook up works for my system?
*Asked by @TheBullzfan33 (3 likes)*

**A:** My Q doesn't have nav either. The MK6 comes with an  antenna that enables all the GPS apps. Thx for watching!! 🙏🏽

### Q: Thank you for the videos, you are truly amazing. I have a question. I noticed that since I've installed this when I go to charge my phone from the USB it's a slow charging and basically doesn't even charge my phone. Any suggestions?
*Asked by @ineed2travel (2 likes)*

**A:** Yeah the USB ports don't supply enough amperage to fast charge. Sometimes, depending on what's running on the phone, it doesn't charge at all as you mention. I only use the included USB ports for thumb drives and accessories, and have a fast charger hooked up in my arm rest to keep my phone topped up.

Thanks for watching man, enjoy that MK6 🤘😎

### Q: I’ve been getting comments of distorted hands free call. I connected the external mic and place behind the screen, think that may be causing it. Any way to disconnect the external mic without me having to rip it out?

**A:** You're gonna need to unplug it unfortunately. You can just remove it completely

### Q: Don’t know if mine was installed incorrectly but when I go to CarPlay it doesn’t play any audio, but I go to the factory menu from the top screen and go to Bluetooth on that I can hear my music, and then I switch back to CarPlay and it goes off again. Any help please?
*Asked by @234RandomGuy (2 likes)*

**A:** Based on what you said, your phone's playing through bluetooth instead of CarPlay.  Change the output on your phone from bluetooth to CarPlay.

### Q: Bought and installed the unit and had one quick question, does the reverse camera automatically pop up when you put the car in reverse? I have to press the camera button on the console for the reverse camera to show up and even then it defaults to the front view or 360 view. Not sure if there's some
*Asked by @rc28ify (1 likes)*

### Q: Ordered and got my unit from you guys last week. Installed. The unit is most impressive but I am having issues using CarPlay.  Bluetooth music on the MK7 sounds great.

### Q: Hello! Are the gps navigator indications still visible in the instrument panel?
*Asked by @Lockley2010 (1 likes)*

**A:** Probably, if you still use the OEM nav. But most people defer to Google maps or Waze or any other navigation app which is far superior to the OEM nav. If you use the apps they obviously won't show on the dash.

### Q: Do we have to get a 4g SIM card from a phone carrier to have access to internet?
*Asked by @cesarcabrera9231 (1 likes)*

### Q: Question about the RCA cables you briefly touched on. My 2019  Q50 has regular speaker and i wanted to istall an amp with sub. What would be the best configuration with the MK6 ?

### Q: When updates come around how do you update it ?
*Asked by @Omar2000Ra (1 likes)*

**A:** I'll do a video with the next update
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Just a quick follow up, because this might be a deal breaker for me. Are you saying the RCA analog outputs from this radio are not variable? They are fixed and DO NOT change volume when the radio volume is adjusted? I will need something that controls volume downstream before my amps?
*Asked by @jayram31 (1 likes)*

**A:** Yes. You’ll encounter the same dealbreaker for every aftermarket option for the Q. It’s a restriction set by the car, not the device.  That said, it doesn’t need to be a dealbreaker, just don’t use the RCAs. Use an LOC or LC7i like every other Q owner.

### Q: Before I order will the AUcar MK6 also support the factory speaker and mike for hands free calling?
*Asked by @joshohana650 (1 likes)*

**A:** Tha MK6 uses the factory speakers for handsfree calls, but it uses it's own mic (it's a little hole on the face of the unit). If you want to use your car's mic, you can still connect the phone to the car via Bluetooth and take calls that way. That's what I did with my MK5.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Hello, IIs there any problem in using the original car bluetooth together with the MK6's bluetooth? or should only connect the MK6?
*Asked by @chemix666 (1 likes)*

**A:** I prefer the car’s bluetooth for calls

*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: What are the most common isues with the mark6?
*Asked by @Rung_Tings_Rude_Bwoy (1 likes)*

**A:** 1. USER ISSUES!! These are full android screens, and they're integrated with the car.  Some things aren't super intuitive, and there's a learning curve that's steeper for some than others. 
2. Carplay/Android Auto - just my opinion, but I think Carplay/AA is crappy in general.  Now when you try to run it in an emulator app on android, it can behave unpredictably (especially since the emulator/carplay engine/individual apps are constantly changing/updating).  Its why I say carplay/AA is a waste.  ditch it and run these screens as they were intended! 

Good question!!

### Q: How long does it usually take for this unit to ship out and delivered once the order is placed?

There's a status bar at the top of the site that lets you know if there are any delays with vendors or supply chains.

### Q: I have a question. Why would I want to use oem navigation? I have it but have a 2016 that likely hasn’t been updated (in touch app now longer supported since the death of 3g) and I can’t imagine wanting to retain functionality for that since I would likely use my phone hotspot with apple maps 247 (c
*Asked by @Ghillieman04 (1 likes)*

**A:** Agreed OEM navigation is TRASH (has been since day 1 in my opinion).  When I mention use OEM navigation in the video, I'm only referring to the ANTENNAS.  You can either use the GPS puck that comes with the unit, or you can use your car's GPS antennas for a slightly simpler install.

I really suggest installing it yourself but I totally understand how it looks intimidating.  Just choose wisely: I've just heard horror stories about "pros" doing the install and completely botching it, then blaming the unit for the damage they've caused.  These are plug-and-play units and its virtually impossible to plug something into the wrong spot.  If your installer is cutting and splicing wires, you picked the wrong installer!!
