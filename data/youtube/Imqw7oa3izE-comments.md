### Q: Brother, thank you for such an amazing presentation. I'm about to install the Phoenix mkiii on my Q50s. It's been 2 years since your install of the AU car mk5. How has it stood to the  test of time, did you ever go back to stock? Again, thank you for your awesome efforts. 👌
*Asked by @Arca. (3 likes)*

**A:** I've been daily-driving the MK6 (next generation) since it came out.  It lives up to the hype! Wouldn't go back to stock if you paid me to!

### Q: Great Great video and very informative i have a question do you do installation for others? Thank you.
*Asked by @tonij4073 (1 likes)*

**A:** Nope I just mess around on my own car.  Thanks for watching!
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: you have some great videos and a perfect voice for narration.  i'm a novice car guy but you seem to be the expert to this product and install.  is the newer AUCar tesla screen still being delayed?  is this sergey firmware i'd pay $100 for, a lifelong service?  does your coupon code still work?
*Asked by @yeeman7421 (3 likes)*

**A:** Thanks your your support Yeeman! 

1) yes the new screen is still severely delayed. The shutdowns in Shenzhen certainly aren't helping 😮‍💨
2) the Sergey software is a one time purchase, and he frequently provides updates (ota in most cases) that resolve issues and unlock new features. I can't say enough good things, I'm a big fan of how he works.
3) coupon code is still active, both on my site and on Aucar's

Thanks for watching! Lemme know if I can answer any questions!

### Q: Does 14:10 cable allow the usb ports to work with the aucar? On my 2014 it doesnt work. I saw there is a harness for 2 usb ports that connects via a brown port on the back of the aucar but no idea where the usb ports from the harness go
*Asked by @rc28ify (2 likes)*

**A:** varies by car.  I can't use the OEM usb ports for the tesla screen on my car but I've heard it works for others. 

run the USB ports either to the armrest or to your glovebox.

### Q: Great video.  I think I will be replacing my carplay unit shortly.  Quick question though.  You mention you need to install the microphone so I assume that means the unit will not operate with the OEM microphones?  Also, where did you put the microphone?

**A:** Works great with OEM microphones. I installed mine in a junk drawer 😅
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: I see you had the smartautokit installed on it before this. Do you need to take remove the daughterboard on the top screen from the smartautokit in order to make this work?
*Asked by @onlam8843 (1 likes)*

**A:** I don't think I needed to, but I did because they're duplicative - the MK5 does everything the SAK unit does and more. 

Plus I wanted to share a vanilla-like install experience since that's what most will be dealing with 🤘🏾😎

*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Just some questions just cause you did it all and your so informative, I can imagine you tested a lot of stuff. For example the aucar mic, do you have to use it? Or can the infiniti factory mics for the hand free still work? Are there any functions that you lost thanks tlt he tesla screen or does ev
*Asked by @apperez2406 (2 likes)*

**A:** -no need to use the included mic, the system will fallback to your OEM mics
-all factory functions are retained and you have access to the factory menus via InTouch.
-all screens ship with the latest firmware and updates are infrequent. In the event of an update, it's done via USB
- OEM gps works, but the beauty of these screens is they're full Android so you can use Google or Waze navigation which in my opinion is infinitely better than oe nav

Also note: the MK6 is out now.

### Q: What about for 2018 and above, can this unit operate smoothly with those models?…
*Asked by @joshualouis4769 (1 likes)*

**A:** Up to 2019 I can say works consistently.  Wiring changed in the 2020+, and AuCar sends a different unit for them.  I haven't had anyone with a 2020+ order from me, so I really can't report on them confidently.

### Q: I started getting speaker pop when switching audio inputs after the install. Any fix for this?
*Asked by @seanedwards1559 (1 likes)*

**A:** Weird - when you switch inputs in InTouch?  Almost sounds like a bad ground somewhere - do you have any aftermarket stereo stuff?
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: I do have a question? Since I have a 2018 Q50 S , would I lose the heated steering wheel option ? For climate controls?
*Asked by @peternaraine6302 (1 likes)*

*Asked by @hyle6364 (1 likes)*

**A:** Not sure/it depends Most of the normal android stuff should work, but any of the stuff that relies on data to/from the car might not (like fm radio, drive mode selector, control knob, AC, etc]
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Thanks for the great vid...I ordered and am about to start the install. My biggest question...does the unit not use the mic and speakers from the OEM? do you have to use the mic/speaker provided in the kit in order to do hands free calls? I would think that once you are in "car play" it would use th

**A:** 100% correct
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: That looks sweet bro!!! My question is what happens to the top monitor? I see it's behind the MK5 but does it come on when the car is on as well as the MK5? Does it stay dormant behind the screen?
*Asked by @edwardlopez7552 (1 likes)*

**A:** It's still back there on and doing it's thing. The MK5 just piggybacks the signal 👍🏾
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: What is the difference between this and the Mark 5 PX6?
*Asked by @bn4241 (1 likes)*

**A:** This is the PX6 Mark5. Px6 just describes the chipset.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Is the Bose sound system affected by this? Really considering doing this but only if I don’t lose sound quality.
*Asked by @vicentemeza6157 (2 likes)*

**A:** Nope - this unit basically sends sound through your factory AUX channel, so your Bose processing and amplification is unaffected
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Nice. Thinking about it. My lower screen is getting cloudy and bubbling.. Too much heat in FL. (2014 Q50) Might be a nice upgrade. But on video, the side buttons (defrost) looks a little wonky. Is it noticable or fixable?
*Asked by @chiromike22 (1 likes)*

**A:** Fitment/buttons is perfect, it may have been a funny camera angle 🤔

Be sure to stay tuned, the next iteration of this screen (MARK6) is now out! Details coming soon.

### Q: Hi, do you know if the uber driver app will run on this?
*Asked by @bartrad9789 (1 likes)*

*Asked by @rajac9927 (1 likes)*

**A:** This is the old model, the MK6 (next gen) launched over a year ago. Check out the MK6 overview video  on this channel 🤘😎

### Q: So this can hookup to subwoofers?
*Asked by @jonathanwhitehawk663 (0 likes)*

**A:** It sends audio through the cars AUX channel so anything you can do with the stock headunit applies 👍🏾
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: How does the audio sound?
*Asked by @thomaskg1198 (1 likes)*

**A:** Sounds good to me - I've heard other people complain about audio on these units (MK3/MK5) but I don't understand it at all - they put out audio through AUX so it's processed the same way as any other audio.  I'm wondering if the ones complaining are overboosting the gains on the unit itself, so it sends muddy audio through the system????

### Q: Hey does the videos like YouTube still play on here or that's no longer active?
*Asked by @Joseph_Prince_Pena (1 likes)*

**A:** YouTube and YouTube tv work great, I use em daily 👍🏾
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: May be a dumb question.  I am thinking of getting the Mark 6 which I assume is a similar install.  I also have the smartautokit tab version.  Did you need to open the screen and remove the PCM board or just the piggy back?  I really dont want to have to open screen again lol.
*Asked by @Bwonan01 (1 likes)*

**A:** I hear you, I've had the smartautokits and done the install 🤣🤣

I removed it completely before installing the MK5/MK6 but that was just because I wanted to resell it.. I can't guarantee it would work with the pcm board still in, but my gut says you would probably be fine.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Nice vid. Just got a Mk 5 too. Did you find a user manual or the password for for the advanced settings? That way we're able to have more customizable access.

### Q: I have a 2014 q50s and both my screens have recently been going black but the camera still works sometimes and some days both screen work perfectly fine until I turn off the car.I want to get this mark 5 screen but I’m not sure if I need to replace anything ?
*Asked by @bigbonebhabon3747 (1 likes)*

**A:** Depends what's causing the screens to go out. If it's a screen issue, then no need to replace anything, this unit would work. But if it's something upstream from the screens (like wiring or source signals), then it might still go black when you're in the InTouch menus. Everything else should work tho.

### Q: Can I run a sub through the rca output only or would you have to connect the rest of the sound system to a separate amp and run those to the stock speakers??
*Asked by @tunikaranja5396 (0 likes)*

**A:** You could, you'd just need to figure out a way to control the subwoofer volume separately. Not worth the effort in my opinion

### Q: bare with me as i ask this possibly stupid question- will i have any trouble using an iphone with this ‘android’ unit? like apple
carplay & whatnot? is it any more
or any less compatible for someone with an android?
*Asked by @lukedasilva6028 (1 likes)*

**A:** Not a stupid question. The only time where your phone would batter is when you're running Carplay or Android auto.  Carplay and Android Auto both operate well, through the same app (Zlink). 

There is a slight edge to having an iPhone: carplay works both wired and wirelessly, while Android auto is wired only

### Q: For some reason the audio only works when I use the stock “intouch” screen but not through any other platforms on the screen. Have you had any problems like this or suggestions?
*Asked by @anthonygiamundo1461 (0 likes)*

**A:** Make sure your audio source is set to AUX. If that doesn't work, make sure all your connections in the back are seated/snapped in good and tight.  I bet it's one of them. If not, hit me on live chat on the site, I'll get u hooked up with support 👍🏾👍🏾

### Q: Hey brother hear any updates on the MK6 version of this? I am super charging my car this month so the ability to display gauges on the new version is super appealing.

### Q: I've heard that some people have issues with their 360 camera and that the map/camera/back buttons don't work. Is this the case for you? That's the only thing holding me back.
*Asked by @DertyMike (1 likes)*

**A:** That's true. You're referring to a known issue that only exists on 2018 Redsports with 360 cameras. The camera button doesn't work, so you can't trigger 360 view by pressing it. 360 view still automatically turns on when u put the car in reverse or when the sonar is triggered. 

This issue doesn't affect other years/trims, so if you have a another year or trim you're good.

**A:** Pre-welcome to the VQ Q50 family! Yeah the OEM screens are useless (in my opinion).  I love the Tesla screen upgrade.  Its not perfect, and its definitely not iPad speeds but its way better responsiveness and infinitely better features than the OEM screens. And yes totally compatible with a 14.

### Q: so the head unit is always connected to 4g no need to pay for services ? or does it piggy back off your phone?
*Asked by @WolF-hg7ih (0 likes)*

**A:** You pay for a 4g plan through your carrier and insert the sim into the unit for full-time data. OR you can setup your phone as a hotspot if u want to piggyback off your phone's data

### Q: Is that the airbag light on there???
*Asked by @adyuaic (1 likes)*

### Q: Thanks for a great video. Quick question please , I have a 2014 q50 and the bottom screen started with an issue not loading all apps so I’m seriously considering replacing the stock layout with the one in your vid. Replacement for standard unit in South Africa Nissan is charging 56K, it’s crazy. So 
*Asked by @Reaper-cs7qt (1 likes)*

**A:** Makes perfect sense Phill.

So yes, these units work with 2014+ Q50s.  But the screen is definitely a "piggyback" - in the InTouch menus I demoed, it was actually displaying the cars menus. Not emulating, not an app. So if that functionality isn't working on your car currently, the problems would probably persist (unless the issue is just with your factory screen, and not the computer behind it)

Hope that helps? Good luck man

### Q: Hey bro. I jus got a 2018 Q50 Redsport this month and i also purchased the Tesla Mark 5 radio for my car. Im enjoying it but i have a question. Does the drive mode trigger become obsolete after installing the Mark 5 in the car? Can u do a video on the drive mode trigger and the other features on the
*Asked by @terrencer3412 (1 likes)*

**A:** Drive mode selector still works great.  When toggling it, the drive mode shows up on the gauge cluster, not the screen.  

To change any settings/set your personal mode, go into InTouch and you should see all the OEM menus there.

RE: Dash cam - there's no specific dash cam for the MK5 but if you have a dash cam with HDMI or RCA out, I believe the MK5 can act as a DVR for it.  Note - I haven't tested this myself!

*Asked by @kenkirchoff1743 (0 likes)*

### Q: Couple questions. 1, I have two subs in my trunk. Any extra wiring I need to do? 2, my car came factory with a gps. So do I still need to use the antenna in the kit?
*Asked by @HTX_Mikey (1 likes)*

**A:** Good questions.
1) NOPE plug and play. You may want to use the 16-band EQ to fine tune the sound but that’s it
2) Assuming you’re getting the MK6 (not the mk5 in this video), it will come with an adapter so you can use your factory gps antenna. You can throw the kits puck away.

### Q: Is there a difference between the MK5 clone and the original? Is one recommended over the other? Also, does the forward camera and 360 view work with this? I only heard mention of the rear camera? And lastly, what does the firmware upgrade actually upgrade? Is it needed to operate properly?
*Asked by @cellusd7869 (1 likes)*

**A:** Hardware wise, they're similar, if not the same. Apparently there's a different software version on the clone. I haven't seen it to be able to compare.

Forward/360 cameras work on all years/trims. When I made this video, the only context I had was my own Q, which only has rear cameras.

This link lists most of the tweaks the firmware upgrade enables. In general, it runs much smoother with less lag when running multiple apps at once: https://squarewheelsauto.com/products/sergey-firmware-request

### Q: I have a couple of questions.  The Mark 5 I received came with a dual USB cable that connects to the back of the unit.  Is this a extra set for the rear passengers, for example?  Also, do I have to use the Mark 5 mic or the will the Q50 mic continue to work after the Mark 5 is installed?  Thanks!
*Asked by @dguadalupe007 (1 likes)*

**A:** The 2 USBs are inputs for the MK5 unit. I ran my mine through the center armrest, and I use them to plug in external thumb drive or connect my phone to use Android Auto.

I didn't connect the provided mic, I just use my factory Q50 mic for calls and voice commands. Enjoy!!!
