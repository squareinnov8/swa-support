### Introduction ([0:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_krcJmG4Fo&t=1s))

[Music] hey y'all what's going on rob here square wheels automotive back here in in the office uh with another one today just kind of answering a lot of the questions that you guys have about the au car mark 5 telestyle screen for the infiniti q50 so somehow i have uh unexpectedly become the subject matter expert for these devices or at least a subject matter expert for these devices i got a couple months ago i've been running it and loving it i actually started reselling these things so check me out on my website um every purchase supports the channel so i really appreciate you guys going through me if you end up going through a you car you can still use my coupon code and that helps out too so check it out link in the description for for all your options but let me answer a question that has been coming in a lot it's coming in from a lot of you that are curious about this device which is clearly an android device but you people people you people have

### CarPlay/Android Auto ([1:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_krcJmG4Fo&t=77s))

iphones right so what i did was i went out and got an iphone 10r you know not the latest and greatest but you know it's come out in the last couple years i'm going to walk you through setting up carplay on your iphone and then connecting the au car mark 5 to your car place setup out to the garage i'll see you guys out there oh yeah okay so here i am in the car i've got the iphone and what i've done is completely uh disabled all car play so we can start at the very beginning with setup to access carplay on top navigation there is a button called car auto there you go right there and the car auto right now out of the box is linked to an app called z-link and here's where you will access your

### CarPlay/Android Auto ([2:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_krcJmG4Fo&t=151s))

carplay or android auto now i've got my iphone here and i've gone let me take it all the way back to the beginning in my settings there is a tab called general and then with that there is a tab called carplay i've clicked that and i can see my device here and it's already detected my car which is square wheel surprise surprise i've got carplay in this menu currently disabled but you'll see when i enable it it says connecting so here we are in carplay now on the device so you'll find that it's fairly responsive any of the carplay compatible apps that you've got on your phone will display on the screen and this is all happening

### Wiring ([3:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_krcJmG4Fo&t=214s))

wirelessly right so what it's doing is sending out carplay over the wi-fi and this device is connected to it through wi-fi so it's really just an extension of your phone so spotify will open spotify you can click in and play again pretty low latency pretty quick i've got the volume all the way down but there you go i don't want to get any copyright things so but yeah that's it so clearly carplay works just fine with this device again with an apple iphone all your ways all your navigation you know fairly responsive but just keep in mind it is happening over wi-fi now i haven't tested this why so i've had a chance to uh kind of play around with this interface i've taken it on my daily drive just dropping my kid off at daycare carplay is cool right it's really responsive it's got um it basically uses just the space of the

### CarPlay/Android Auto ([4:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_krcJmG4Fo&t=283s))

screen as an extension of your phone and it refactors some applications that you've got installed on your phone so it can be used on your car's screen so of all the apps i've got on my phone only a percentage of them port over to car place so not all apps that you have on your phone will display on car play um i find that a little bit limiting because if you go the alternate route which is use the tesla screen as you know a full android device then you've got access to all any app in the play store right so if you go down the carplay route you're essentially limited to just the apps that are ported over to carplay um but that's really the only complaint the apps that are ported over work extremely well i haven't had any glitches i can jump between the apps perfectly fine um multitasking seems really cool there

### Troubleshooting ([5:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_krcJmG4Fo&t=347s))

isn't really any issue getting into any of this stuff it works just as seamlessly as if this were my actual i can say pretty good things about that so i ran into one issue that i think is less of an issue and more of a pro tip so the iphone is incapable of providing a hotspot and carplay simultaneously i'm guessing it's because it sends a signal to the unit over wi-fi so if you're sending this carplay signal and you're sending wi-fi internet to it then maybe it's overloading or something like that so carplay and hotspot do not work hand in hand if you're using carplay disable hotspot and vice versa if you're using a hotspot don't try to use carplay because it can only do one thing at a time this is not related to the unit at all this is just the way the iphones work so there you have it i hope that answers your questions if there are any additional questions just go ahead hit me up in the comments i'll do my best to answer them if there's anything else you want me to

### Testing ([6:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_krcJmG4Fo&t=412s))

test out or try or demo also let me know i do think these screens are awesome i think the addition of carplay is an awesome option also i did get word from au carr that december early december i'm going to be getting a prototype device now don't get too excited this is still very early on in their process but it is a major milestone now they do have a product that they've got slated for release to consumers but it's probably going to be glitchy it's probably going to have a lot of iterations of testing and iterations of software so i'm partnering with them to kind of go through and prepare a device that is ready for your consumption realistically it'll probably be february or march of 2022 when you'll be able to start ordering these devices and installing them yourselves so sit tight stay tuned i'm going to bring you guys along on the process so go ahead hit that subscribe button if it's something that you're interested in if not i'll see you on the other side you
