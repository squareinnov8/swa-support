### Introduction ([0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXere6y4rJo&t=0s))

[Music] to take the cup holder on the loose take pine decking profile what's going on y'all it's your boy rob here square wheels auto just a quick one to talk about the installation of the au car mark 6. a lot of you guys are starting to get your packages in the mail pre-orders are wrapping up so all those final orders from june and july are now getting fulfilled and as soon as they're fulfilled uh delivery time is going to go back to the normal so these are shipped out through dhl express and usually they'll take between five and ten days for your doorbell to ring with a new mark six at your door so as you guys are opening up your kits those of you who have come from the mark v probably noticed that the backs of the screens

### Wiring ([1:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXere6y4rJo&t=65s))

and the wiring kits are largely the same what this means is that you can follow my other video and i'll link it down in the description uh wherever that is and that'll get you through ninety percent of the aucar mark six install so i won't walk you through everything end to end all over again unboxing and all that you can watch that other video and that'll get you 90 there before you go you need to know that there's three differences between the au car mark six installation and the old au car mark five installation one gps so if your vehicle has gps and you let us know when you ordered the mark 6 would have been shipped with a gps adapter and that will use your oem antennas instead of the gps that comes with the mark 6 standard the second thing is the mark 6 comes with a 4g sim card holder and two 4g antennas and then the last thing is the mark 6 no longer comes with the rca outputs for your audio and the reason behind that is because it is a little deceiving right when you hook that up and then you hook it up to your amplifier it's an unprocessed signal which means that there's no volume control for it um so if you have like an external volume control for your subwoofer or for your speakers if you got like a sound processor or anything like that and you still want the rca adapters just shoot me a text when you order and i'll make sure one is included in your package so i'm going to talk you through those two differences one the gps if you have a gps and two the 4g sim card holder in this video and it should just take a couple minutes so sit tight okay first things first let's talk about the 4g sim card holder so that's gonna be a little rectangular uh shape thing that'll hold the sim card and it's got like about a four or five

### Installation ([2:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXere6y4rJo&t=176s))

foot long wire with a plastic connector on the end that plastic connector will go into the back of the mark 6 in this spot right here there's really only one place where it can plug in this is the spot that you want to plug it into now the other end you're going to want to route somewhere accessible just in case you're going to want to change your sim card out you know somewhat periodically what i did was ran it right down the front of the mark 6 on the left hand side and i tucked it under the trim so if i ever want to you know change the sim card out i can pull it out and access it but whenever i'm not using it i can tuck it up and only i know that it's there that's it now the unit will also come with two 4g antennas and what i did was route them left and right under the driver and passenger dashboard and then i just put them in these kind of side compartments i'll show you in the in the video um a you car has like a different recommendation but i found that the

### Wiring ([4:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXere6y4rJo&t=250s))

wires weren't quite long enough so i just tucked them on either side here you can either put them in the a-pillars or you can put them on either side i haven't had any issues with signal strength i play videos i play youtube all on that 4g connection through boost mobile and i also tested it with att both work great um so your mileage may vary now the other side of those 4g antennas just plug into either of those screw tips they're cut too side by side i don't think either one matters it's both the same stuff inside you just want to make sure that they're both connected and they both ideally have a view of the sky the other thing you need to know about is the gps adapter now this is going to be a little tricky for me to talk through because i don't have oem gps on my car but my understanding is that once you remove the fascia and you don't have the screen installed the navigation unit sits right underneath the top screen and what you're going to need to do is pull that out behind that top screen you'll see a

connector for the oem gps antenna and that's where the adapter is going to go in so you are going to unplug that adapter you're going to plug one side of the included piggyback adapter from a you car and then you're going to plug the piggyback adapter into the back of the navigation unit then there's going to be another kind of longer end of that adapter that's what you're going to plug into the back of the mark 6 and that's going to be that same screw connector that you plug into the gps spot on the au car mark 6. that's it so that'll give your mark 6 access to the oem gps antenna and then it'll also give your oem navigation if you ever want to use that garbage you you still have access to it that's it i hope all that made sense if there's any comments any questions any concerns anything that i didn't make clear obviously let me know in the comments down below or if you purchase from me feel free to hit me by text or by email i try to be pretty accessible y'all enjoy these mark sixes they are awesome devices i am loving using mine stay tuned because i am doing that other video for the 4g setup for whatever carrier that you've got so stay tuned for that coming soon
