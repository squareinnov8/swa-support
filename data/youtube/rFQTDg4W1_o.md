### Introduction ([0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFQTDg4W1_o&t=0s))

yeah talking to my mirror like i love you so much curving all my critics like i heard you so what you can't kill my confidence i think i'm the myth tally all the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] i ever gave on my head [Music] all right what's up y'all rob here square wheels you asked and i delivered so this past weekend i completed the install of the lighting trends led flow series day running lights on my infiniti q50 i documented everything i'm gonna walk you through the process i went through to opening the headlights up and probably follow these steps if you want to paint the interior parts of your headlights like i did and then obviously the whole installation of the day running lights kit and the wiring uh in the car i covered everything end to end i'm going to add chapters in the bottom so if you feel free to jump ahead at any step also i just kind of made this thing work right so there's no real good documentation no real steps to follow so if you know any better than i did at any of these steps please feel free to let the community know down in the comments also this isn't my last headlight project this is actually just my second headlight project so i'm planning on going back in maybe experimenting with a different headlight controller maybe configuring some startup animations um some sequentials anything that you guys are interested in let me know down in the comments and i'll feature them in a

### Testing ([1:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFQTDg4W1_o&t=95s))

future video thanks for checking me out if you haven't already like and subscribe thanks so much so as i mentioned before this isn't the first time that i opened up a set of headlights so on this q50 a few months ago i opened them up i painted all the internals and i frosted the crest and brows the whole reason that i'm doing this now is because after doing that they weren't as bright as i wanted them to be so with this install i got some nice bright white leds and then i also have added bonus of all these animations now honestly i probably won't be using these animations uh very frequently but it's a cool you know little added bonus that that i appreciate all right to get this project started you're gonna need to take the bumper off so you'll be able to see as i go through this process um kind of strategically working my way around the headlight just removing things that i need to

### Removal ([2:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFQTDg4W1_o&t=157s))

remove in order to get it free first step is jacking up the vehicle so you can get to the bolts underneath the bumper all right once i got the vehicle secured i'm popping the hood and you can see i'm starting to work around the trim directly around the headlights removing any bolts that i see with a 10 millimeter uh socket a lot of these uh plastic trims are just held in with these uh little rivets and you're probably really familiar with this if you've removed your bumper or change your filters before i'm spelling if i got it then she got it tell us this trim here pops up all you need to do is uh pull it kind of straight up just be careful not to break anything but pretty durable and then under here you'll see one bolt that holds your headlight in position again just a 10 millimeter socket here all right here's another reason why we lifted the vehicle uh what we're going to want to do is get behind this plastic fender liner here and what you'll find is there's another 10 millimeter bolt that is holding the bumper to the

### Removal ([4:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFQTDg4W1_o&t=260s))

car just remove that carefully make sure you save that clip otherwise you're gonna look like all the nissan and infinity guys that have removed their bumpers before that every time they walk by their car they have to hit it with their knee to get it back in place all right once you got those bolts and clips removed you should be able to start prying your bumper away if you ever feel any resistance make sure you stop there's probably another screw that you need to find to free it up uh don't forget the bumper bolts underneath uh the bumper yours may look a little different than mine because i've got a toll booth willie um under tray here aluminum under tray but you're gonna want to remove all these bolts that hold the bumper to your under tray um and once you've done this you should start feeling the bumper getting pretty loose and i get some bears um if you're feeling the bumper get loose you may want to get a friend to help support don't be an idiot like i did and drop your bumper and you can put some towels down so you're not scratching your paint

### Installation ([5:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFQTDg4W1_o&t=329s))

once your bumper's free uh disconnect those any wiring that you've got to your fog lights or to your turn signals i'm sure everybody's got them they're just little clips you can use your screwdriver to push the pin down and remove them and once that wiring is disconnected you should be free to carry your bumper away somewhere safe all right with the bumper gun you're just going to want to keep up the process and keep removing these 10 10 millimeter bolts until the headlight is free you'll find them kind of strategically placed all around the headlight and the more you remove the more the headlight will start getting loose and you'll be able to start pulling it out all right milestone here there's only one

### Wiring ([6:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFQTDg4W1_o&t=394s))

real harness that holds the headlight and all the wiring for it and there's one little tab that holds that harness on it's kind of a pain in the butt it really helps to pull the headlight out flip it upside down see that tab and push that tab down with a screwdriver and then the headlight should be free to come out all right now that we got the headlights out of the car and into our work area we can start getting them ready to bake and uh remove the lenses so we can get to those internal components now there's just two things we need to be sure of before we put these things in the oven one is make sure that there's no wires or any multiple components that are exposed and two is make sure that we get all the screws uh out of the headlights that will hold the lens on because as soon as it comes out of the oven what we're going to want to do is separate the lens from the rest of the body so we can you know pull it away and get to those insides is all right this is an important step here before you turn

### Testing ([8:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFQTDg4W1_o&t=515s))

the oven on make sure you test fit your headlight in the oven and make sure that nothing plastic and nothing visible is touching any metal components i learned this the hard way when i baked my g37 headlights i ended up melting a part of the lens and it didn't look very good so important step make sure you test fit uh these headlights in your oven before you turn the oven on and set any heat on it all right once you test fit you got your positioning you can take it out and set your oven set it to 275 degrees and i have to sit tight while it gets up to temperature once it does you set your timer for seven minutes and you go ahead and pop the headlight in the oven the exact same way that you test fitted it and again make sure that nothing plastic is touching anything metal while it's in the oven you want to pop on some gloves because it's going to be hot when it gets out uh you also want to make sure that you've got a screwdriver or some kind of pry tool handy um this is going to help you kind of separate the lens away from the body of the headlight and we'll talk you through that as soon as this thing comes out of the oven all right sitting tight and waiting and that's looking good enough let's get it out all right what you're going to want to do is be as quick as possible you want to maintain this heat and keep that sealant nice and gooey so it'll be really easy to separate the lens from the body so i'm going right to my workshop putting this down on a table

### Configuration ([10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFQTDg4W1_o&t=622s))

and setting right to kind of prying it apart now when you're prying just make sure that you're not applying too much pressure in one spot you don't want to bend the plastic enclosure so i use kind of the broad side of the screwdriver and just made it real kind of generalized pressure as i'm prying apart and i kind of just focused on the corners anything that was going to make it easier for me to kind of hand pry these lenses apart on a new couch with my chucks on get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] on with that bit cool on a small chat cause i know now that i'm all that got a hot guy on the ball can't get the [&nbsp;__&nbsp;] out of my face huh talking to my mirror like i love you so much carving all my critics like i heard you you can't kill my confidence on my head i'm starting to make some progress here so you can see it's really just pulling you know to break that that seal and once you you know break the seal just keep on pulling as long as you got all those screws out it'll be relatively easy you just gotta do consist consistent pressure on it and uh let's get into this other side and good guy that is so satisfying once that gets out

### Installation ([11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFQTDg4W1_o&t=718s))

so our next step here is disconnecting all the uh oe connectors to these components uh you don't really need to remember which one goes where because there's only one way for them to go back together all these are going to have to go back once you close the headlight up because not none of this gets affected by your install now here's another major key so to pull the interior headlight components away from its enclosure there's these two bolts right here and the key right here is to loosen them a little bit at a time and alternate until those two screws are completely loose you can't do it all one screw at a time or else you're going to be fighting against yourself and it's going to be really difficult to get them separated so just keep alternating a couple turns on each of them and that should um remove it and then there's going to be one more bolt kind of opposite these two the key to that one is there's two tiny little tabs on it that are preventing it from coming through that sleeve if you depress those two tabs are on opposite sides of each other then the interior part of this headlight enclosure comes right out from this point once we're we've got this uh the headlight assembly out we're just

### Removal ([13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFQTDg4W1_o&t=806s))

you know removing screws again so you remove the four screws on the back of the headlight enclosure and then there's a couple other screws that keep this metal heatsink in place you just keep removing screws and this thing will start falling apart just remember how you did it because you're gonna have to do everything backwards to put it back together this is pretty much it so once you've hit this point you've got everything apart that you need to in order to paint your interior assembly and also frost your crested brows if you're looking for information on that uh shoot me a message it's really simple all you're doing is you know scratching it down and uh painting it or frosting it um so there's not really too much to it the hardest part is really just pulling everything out and getting it assembled be patient if you're painting that's one more major key all right so let's talk this retrofit kit so this is the lighting trends uh kit um i'll link it in the description but one thing that i found frustrating about this whole process was that even on the website it didn't let you know exactly what you were going to get it didn't let you know how many components were involved it didn't let you know how you're supposed to run power or you know what what actual elements are required to make up a complete kit so as i unbox this like it was completely a learning experience i didn't know what went where i didn't

### Wiring ([15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFQTDg4W1_o&t=915s))

know what plugged into what but i want to walk you through today so at least there's some stake in the ground that you know you guys can refer to if you guys want to do this yourself so one thing i did know was that i was going to want to test all this stuff before i actually installed in the car just to make sure it worked so what i did was got this power unit off of amazon and basically what this does is converts you know wall power to dc power and it puts out 12 volts of electricity just like your car would so this allows you to test all the leds everything that comes in the kit just to make sure that it works and understand how everything works together too okay so let's dig in i've hooked up power from my amazon use it to the wiring from the lighting trends it has a positive and a ground and the positive is a fused cable which is really nice and this goes to the first unit which is the power supply you can tell it's a power supply because it's got a heat sink on it from the power supply you provide power what's called the control unit and this is the lighting trends flow series control unit and it's got four outputs on it those four outputs go to any of those led components you get like the eyebrows or the crescent or you know halos whatever you want to do you can hook up to these four channels and this actually included splitters so you can actually have multiple components on a single channel which is cool now the last thing that comes off the power unit is a align for the bluetooth controller and i thought this was really cool because i i've got a couple of these bluetooth controllers it's the sp-110e it's usually used for like uh home automation you know your your counter lights and all all that stuff um but you know it's a cheap 10 bluetooth unit but basically this is what you're going to use to control your lights

### CarPlay/Android Auto ([17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFQTDg4W1_o&t=1050s))

uh from you know the app on your phone or your you know whatever device so the bluetooth unit talks to the control unit and tells all the leds what's what to do that's pretty much all there is to it i mean it's not it's not uh brain surgery it's not rocket science it's just these units that need to uh play together basically to make your uh headlights work so where it gets interesting is kind of plugging all this stuff in and making sure that it's secure in your car all right so now's the exciting part so what i'm doing here is fitting the eyebrow on the top of the driver's side headlight now this looks like a standard 18 inch strip of led all the leds are placed pretty closely together on the lighting trends kit which is really nice it also comes with this white diffusion which really helps to hide each of the individual leds and make it look like a nice solid bar of light really cool i can see that the light goes all the way across and i'm gonna need to find some way for it to sit flush but still have the

### Wiring ([18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFQTDg4W1_o&t=1128s))

power wire uh come through so what i'm gonna do is drill a hole in this um just wide enough that i'll be able to run the actual wire through and then have the rest of the you know factory eyebrow sit on top of this and have a nice clean look i'm not really worried about drilling anything uh because no matter what i put the factory eyebrow right back on top of this so even if i take everything out and go all the way back to stock this eyebrow will hide everything it'll look all the same to anybody that's even looking really closely at the now i know i could use the dremel for this but honestly i couldn't find the tools and the drill just worked just fine so so now that i got this position on the

### Wiring ([20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFQTDg4W1_o&t=1225s))

wire side i'm stripping off the uh backing from that 3m adhesive and i'm just going to stick it in place right at the eyebrow spot on the headlight so it's sitting down real nice which is good or so we'd think so we see me here doing a bit more fiddling on the inside of the headlight because of that oh so distinctive dip down so what we see here is that the led strip is actually pretty rigid so it's really hard to maneuver it around this corner i talked to some people after i did this and it turns out that they didn't even bother you know making it go down the curve so you know consider that when you're going through this what i ended up doing was um cutting some of that diffuser to make it a bit more flexible and then pushing you know it down and using adhesive to make it stick and go through the curve this is one of those moments though where i'm really looking for help because i wouldn't mind going back in here this didn't come out perfect so if anyone's got any pointers on this please hit me down in the comments as you can see i got this all fitted and back together but the factory eyebrow doesn't click back into place so if you're looking really closely you can see that it's not

### Installation ([21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFQTDg4W1_o&t=1316s))

you know a perfect install anyway if you're close enough to see my flaws you're too close man so i tried things a little differently with the passenger eyebrow so i could tell that i was having fitment issues because the diffusion was so thick that it really made it hard for the oe eyebrow to fit on top of it so what i did right off the bat was i decided to make it not as fat so i carefully got a razor and i actually cut the led strip out of the diffusion panel just to see how it would look um you know because i already frosted my eyebrows i figured i might get a nice solid looking line anyway so i carefully cut the diffusion off of the led strip and pull the led strip completely out of it and try to fit it just with no diffusion at all two it actually turned out fitting pretty nicely and sitting pretty nicely but i could still kind of see that uh there are some dots you can't really see it in the video but you can see the individual leds just a little bit more than you could with the full diffusion on there so i decided to just make both my headlights match and put the diffusion uh back on i didn't put the entire thing on so i still use the led strip and then i just used adhesive to stick it to the headlight itself and then i took the top layer diffusion and just put it on top with some super glue a couple spots along the entire line and that made it sit pretty nice so this way i was able to get the leds in place get the diffusion in place and still put the factory eyebrow on top and my fitment was a lot better on the passenger side uh um all right next up we've got the crescent i already showed you how to take the crescent out of the headlight enclosure so this is just the last step it's only held on by a couple steps and the factory crescent is really just kind of like a strip of about five or six

### Wiring ([25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFQTDg4W1_o&t=1511s))

leds that's plugged into the factory harness just unplug that and then what you're going to want to do is grab the lighting trends crescent and it's basically in the exact same shape so what you're going to want to do is just put that crescent strip exactly in the exact same spot where the oe one was and if you do it correctly then all the led lights will line up and shine into the crescent and illuminate your crescent really easy just put the old one or put the new one in where the old one came out now i didn't even realize this when i did the driver's side headlight but these uh lighting trends crescents they actually come with adhesive on there so it's it looks like kind of 3m backing if you peel the pat the backing it'll stick in place but i haven't had any issues like not using the adhesive um so you know do whatever you want so that's it y'all like the crazy hard part is pretty much done now you can start you know putting things back together

### Wiring ([26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rFQTDg4W1_o&t=1585s))

um just making sure that your wires or wires for the aftermarket drl boards are all kind of situated together so they can run out the back of the headlight all right this step is totally optional you know use the chapters and jump ahead if you don't care about it but whenever i got the headlights out of the car i always like to refinish the surface of the headlights um it usually gets rid of all the rock chips and any scratches that i might have got on there and have a nice clean surface you know for uh clearing what that entails is basically just wet sanding it so you start with a thousand grit and you get like nice and hazed up get all the clear coat off of the surface of the lens and then you increase your grit you get some 2000 smooth it out get it nice and hazy 3000 smooth it out get it nice and hazy and you just hit it with a polisher and your surface is like glass so i do this every time it's outside of the car just so i'm not you know accidentally messing up any of my paint work
