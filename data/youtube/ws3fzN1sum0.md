### Introduction ([0:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws3fzN1sum0&t=3s))

[Music] um hey what's up y'all rob here square wheels this is part two of the infiniti q50s lighting trends flow series day running light kit installation first off thank you for the support uh there's really an outpouring of support in the comments on that first video of everyone that's really feeling empowered to go ahead and do this shout out specifically to carl24 he's got his bumper off and his headlights out right now probably waiting for uh this video so again thank you to everybody who's you know feeling empowered and taking the steps and doing this themselves it's not rocket science y'all you just to have the information and i'm putting it out there if you haven't seen part one you're jumping ahead a little bit in that video i cover the headlight removal what you need to do to open and paint the components uh detailed overview of the kit from lighting trends and then a detailed

### Installation ([1:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws3fzN1sum0&t=71s))

installation of all the flow series crescent and eyebrow components in your headlights themselves so if you haven't seen that first go like and subscribe because it's free why wouldn't you and then go check out that video once you check that out then you'll be ready for part two i'm already guaranteeing there's going to be a part three because i've already got the parts on order for etched lenses for sequentials for startup animations i'm going to install the blue ghost controller so a brand new controller um so i'm i'm diving in head first to this whole uh headlight retrofit world uh sharing all the info as i learn it just to kind of take the the mask of of this being you know super special only pro installers can do it this isn't rocket science it's all just you know cheap little leds okay so let's get to the meat of this specific video so in this video i'm really just gonna be wrapping up the phase one installation right so at the end of it that part one video you had all your components installed and you're probably sealing up your headlight and i'm gonna take you through it from here all right so after

### Installation ([2:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws3fzN1sum0&t=139s))

you got all the components installed i'm guessing you probably just reversed all your steps you got all the screws back in what you need to do is run all the wires from the light and trends dave running light kit out through that hole in the back of your headlight now i've seen some other people actually drill into the actual headlight enclosure itself and pass the wires through that way but i don't know that makes me a little nervous i like to leave the headlight as stock as possible so what i did was just drill the little plastic cap that screws onto the back of the headlight and i ran the wires through that and then just to make sure that it's completely weatherproof i used a hot glue gun and just surrounded those wires completely so now if i ever need to take this back to stock i can just remove all the componentry i can get a new cap and just screw it into the old spot and it'll be like nothing ever happened on my headlights once that's all done the only thing left to do

### Installation ([3:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws3fzN1sum0&t=202s))

really is install the headlights right in the same spots that you took them out of make sure that your wiring for the daytime running light kit isn't getting kinked or pinched under anything so i ran it right through the back of the headlight and then ran it towards the passenger side of the engine compartment right in the for the wires that came out of the headlight i pulled them towards the front so they were staying as far away from the heat of the engine bay and i zip tied them to that metal bar that's right above the radiator so i'm feeling really secure that they're going to be watertight and they're also going to be um pretty far away from the heat so it should be pretty good long term here i am on the passenger side just doing the same thing just reinstalling the headlight in the same spot that it came out of and running the wires straight to uh back towards the battery box so while i run around with my micrometer and i tested literally every fuse location so these three here are actually day run light fuse but all of them have a constant 12 volt signal so obviously i can't have a constant signal powering my day running light so they'll never turn off um so now these were appropriate options i feel like these may be good to keep in mind when i switch over to the blue ghost controller next so the next thing i tried was the other fuse box on the passenger side it's a much smaller fuse box right by the battery and once i found a little spot in the relay

### Wiring ([4:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws3fzN1sum0&t=297s))

i tested it actually wiring the day running lights and i could see that it was switched power so let me show you exactly where where it was so right here by the battery there's this tiny little fuse and it only has one little kind of relay in there so all you have to do is pull the cap off of it and that'll expose the relay here now i ran the micrometer through all the ports in this relay and there's only one spot that is confirmed to be a switch spot that only gets power when the ignition is on so you can pull here there's a little plastic tab that holds it to a metal tab and that'll give you a bit more wiggle room and since i already have this wire run in here it's a little tight so i'm prying it up with a screwdriver but you should be able to just push the tab in and pull the relay straight up and that'll get you access to all the ports in here all right here we go so now that the top is popped you can see exactly the port

### Wiring ([6:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws3fzN1sum0&t=363s))

that i wired this 12 v power switch to it's gonna be the bottom left one uh if you're looking at it from right as you pull the fuse box out once you run your wire in there just make sure it's making connection with the port and then obviously once you put the relay back on top of it it should make a good solid connection but once you do this definitely go ahead and test and make sure that you're getting power only when the vehicle is switched on because you don't want to wrap all this back up and realize that you know you don't have a good connection another little tip to make sure that i wasn't pinching the cable i just carved out a little bit of this plastic cap just to make sure that you know i had enough breathing room so that when i put it back on top it's not crimping the cable and you know exposing any any raw wire we could be so if you'll excuse this crew drawing this just shows

### Wiring ([7:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws3fzN1sum0&t=440s))

exactly how i wired and how i positioned everything in the engine bay um so those dashed wires are all the wires from the lighting trend kit those three units are the three units that i showed you in part one that make up the kit and i'm just showing you skip the first fuse box go to that fuse box that's right by the battery and that's where you're going to want to tap your power from this point on you're just kind of reassembling your car putting everything back you know where it was um so all the components are sitting right here behind the passenger side headlight so the step down the control unit as well as a bluetooth controller are all in this area here and what i did just because i tend to be paranoid is bundle everything up in one bundle including any of those connectors that come out of the control unit

### Installation ([8:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws3fzN1sum0&t=502s))

that aren't connected to anything i had two extra connectors free make sure you put them well you don't have to do it but i put them in a plastic bag and i zip tie the plastic bag just to make sure that they were completely protected from any moisture i left the step down converter i left the power supply out in the open because it looked like it was already waterproofed and i didn't want to affect any of the heat dissipation from the heatsink so i left that just sitting there but everything else i put in this plastic bag and i zip tied it then to make sure that you know this thing isn't bouncing around in my engine bay i also zip tied it right to the frame uh to keep it nice and secure it's also right behind the air box so it should be pretty far away from any any heat that's going to do any damage to it after that again we're just kind of putting things all back together we're getting to a point where we can

### Testing ([9:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws3fzN1sum0&t=567s))

start testing this out all right i've got everything buttoned up the led day run lights only turn on when i have the car in accessory mode or i have the ignition on so what i'm doing now is opening up the led hue app and i'm going to give you a quick demo of it so when you open up the app you're immediately going to see all the bluetooth devices in the area you're going to select the one for your bluetooth controller for your headlights which is the sp110p and that will open you right up into the interface where you can start using colors and animations that's pretty much all there is to it i won't walk you through every single animation because i did a separate video on that i'll link it uh up here around here somewhere um so go check that out so you can see all the animation and all the color options that are available with this kit uh that's about it

### Testing ([10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ws3fzN1sum0&t=633s))

uh thank you for checking out the video if it added value for you please like and subscribe it really helps out the channel helps the momentum keep on going thank you for the support more coming so sit tight thanks so much y'all bye
