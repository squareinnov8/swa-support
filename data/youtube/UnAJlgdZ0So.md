### Introduction ([0:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnAJlgdZ0So&t=1s))

all right y'all rob here square wheels uh back with another one uh as promised i've been putting this tesla unit uh through the paces over the last week or so since i installed it a lot of great uh engagement on that last video um i did an installation video for this unit so if you haven't seen that go check it out after this one if you're really interested in the tesla mark 5 by au carr so as i said i've been putting this unit through the paces over the last week or so and i am ready to give my uh thoughts on it so what i'm gonna do uh now is drive back home and i'm gonna walk you through um everything top to bottom on this tesla mark v uh i'm gonna start with hardware i'm gonna go over the software uh i'm going over the features and what make it different from the phoenix automotive mark iii uh so i'm gonna give you the full rundown basically so just sit tight i'm about to pull into the garage in a second i'm going to take a minute and point out the elephant in the room here a you car call this unit the mark v now if you're familiar with android tesla style screens for the infiniti q50 then you're probably well aware of the phoenix automotive mark iii which is the third iteration in a series of phoenix automotive android tesla style screens um the mark iii is without a doubt the most popular the most recognized uh name in the realm of tesla style android units for the infiniti q50 so it's a little weird that au carr just randomly landed on this concept and they called it the mark 5. now i'll leave it up for you to decide you know there's speculation that you know it's just a cheesy marketing ploy to try to pay piggyback on the momentum that the phoenix automotive units had um i don't know it's an elephant in the room i'll let you make a decision on it my decision went to the best unit and this is clearly the best unit so i have asked around in a lot of the forms that are dedicated to these units and really tried to understand all the

### Troubleshooting ([2:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnAJlgdZ0So&t=160s))

glitches all the issues that people were having with the latest iteration the phoenix automotive mark iii all of those issues are resolved in this unit so au car did a really good job of you know feeling out the community making sure that they were addressing those major pain points and i'm confident that this is a much better unit than the phoenix automotive mark iii they shouldn't have called it the mark five that's that's the end of the day that's that's it there i've said it all right now that we got that out of the way let's go through the overview of this au car uh tesla mark 5 screen uh if you haven't already please hit that like button and that subscribe button i've got a lot of exciting pro projects going on specifically with the q50 all right let's talk about the tesla screen all right let's talk about everything you need to know about this unit so this is a 13.6 inch multi-touch capacitive it's at full hd at 1920 by 1080 pixels or for being really specific it's 1080 by 1920 because it is in portrait mode

### CarPlay/Android Auto ([3:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnAJlgdZ0So&t=224s))

it comes with android 9 it's got carplay support wired and wireless card play as well as android auto wired it comes with the px6 chipset which is an improvement from the px3 chipset that you saw on some of those older tesla style screens so you can expect some better performance on this one uh some more responsiveness it comes with four gigabytes of ram 64 gigs of hard drive space and it's got full in touch access so it'll work with all of your original equipment your steering wheel controls your center knob in the middle console everything now you've probably noticed that i haven't turned on this screen yet and i'll get there but i just want to point out the attention to detail and the build quality on this unit because i think it is absolutely superb all the seams all the lines all the buttons they really look like this unit was built for this vehicle it doesn't look like an aftermarket you don't see any weird gaps or anything all the buttons look you know like they're built for this vehicle and i think in general it just elevates the entire look and feel and experience of the interior of this vehicle i really think this is the way that this car should look you know as an entry-level luxury vehicle this is the way that the interior should look speaking of buttons you will notice uh when you look at the but the hard buttons on the bottom of this unit they're different than the phoenix automotive or any other tesla screen this au car screen features a customizable

### Configuration ([5:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnAJlgdZ0So&t=318s))

hard button where in the settings you can control exactly what you want to pop up when you push this button so just for example i've got mine configured to open up the myq garage door opener so as i'm approaching the house i just click that button and i can control both of my garage door openers from a wider range than i would be able to with the regular car garage opener all right enough about the hard buttons let's see what this device does when it is turned on so to start as i said this is a full android tablet unit and what that means is that it comes with the google play store what that means is that you can install essentially any app that's in the google and have it run independently on this device so this tesla mark v it does come with wi-fi support so all you need to do is provide it a hot spot what i usually do right before i get into the vehicle is i switch my mobile phone into hotspot mode and i provide an interactive connection to the mark v

### CarPlay/Android Auto ([6:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnAJlgdZ0So&t=381s))

this way i can put the phone away i don't need to be switching between devices and the phone just provides internet to the mark v and the mark 5 handles all the display and all the processing runs all the apps that it needs to okay very common question is in touch support so at the top navigation there's this button called intouch and this gives you access to all of the factory screens that your car came with so the top screen the bottom screen all of your radio controls all of your settings driving dynamics basically anything that you had on those factory screens those factory menus you do have access to it is just as responsive as the oe screens so there's no you know no big difference here this unit also supports your hvac your heated seats basically everything works all right this button on the top nav is definitely my personal favorite so there is a video button and this unit comes with an hd video player so what i do is i load up a usb thumb drive with all kinds of music videos but you can essentially put any video on there and through this video player you can play videos either full screen or you can dock them to the top or the bottom of the screen so you can run you know multiple apps at the same time so what i like to do when i'm just driving around is have my navigation on the top screen and have you know music videos playing on the bottom and you can switch them vice versa in the in the ui as shown here love the video player all right common question and also

### Troubleshooting ([8:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnAJlgdZ0So&t=481s))

common problem that happened on the mark iii units was support for backup cameras and 360 cameras i'm pleased to say that the mark 5 doesn't have any of those issues it worked perfectly with my backup camera i can see where it's got 360 and sensor the only complaint is i could tell there was a slight delay it's almost like a half second delay on the turning lines but it wasn't really anything that affected the functionality it was more just an annoyance for me that's gonna do it if you are interested in this mark 5 unit by aucar i will link it down in the description i do have a coupon code coupon code is square wheels if you put that in you're going to get a couple bucks off of your purchase au card has been really good about chipping these out they're sending out through dhl so they'll get to your doorstep door-to-door in about five days so uh really good there awesome unit you guys have any questions any concerns anything that i didn't cover in the video hit me up in the comments i'll do my best to answer look at all my videos you know i'm very active in the comments i love the engagement so go ahead hit me up either in the comments on youtube or hit me up on ig or email all my details are at the bottom of all my videos
