### Q: Quick question Rob, I know it’s not often we’re all taking our vehicle in for service but if we need to take our Q50 in for service will the Infiniti technician be able to easily use the Apex cluster to find whatever thing there looking for after and while there working on your car?

Also we super a
*Asked by @Wave876-RS (3 likes)*

**A:** Thx for the kind words! Most of the service diagnostics will be fed to the service techs over OBDII. But to answer your question directly, Everything that the OEM cluster displays, the APEX will display.  And the steering controls you use to access it via the menus are identical, also.  

I'll definitely shoot some content on the interior/cluster after SEMA... I know I've been holding out too long!!

### Q: Wait so does this not work with the hybrid?
I feel like it could just use the oem style screen for the hybrid specific screens (energy flow, etc) cuz it uses the same 2 ports which transmit the same information right?
*Asked by @SNOWB1RD-19 (3 likes)*

**A:** Any of the screens are recreated from scratch, nothing is passed through from the car except raw data. The hybrid screens have not been recreated and there’s no confirmation that the harnesses and pinouts are the same. Nissan is notorious for making things non-standardized unnecessarily 😤
