### Q: Thanks this video is really helpful and will make my install a lot easier. The only question I have is did you install the halo LED ?
*Asked by @pedrocruz1829 (2 likes)*

**A:** Happy to help!!! So I bought the halos, but I didn't like the way they ended up looking, so I didn't use them.  I keep them as testers for my controllers now =)

### Q: Great video bro. Mind telling what type of paint you used and frost for the headlights?
*Asked by @Drizzydrakedrama (1 likes)*

**A:** I've used different kinds.  In this video I'm pretty sure I used Rustoleum Frosted Glass.

### Q: In part 2 are you going to do the demon eyes?
*Asked by @Awsometiger1011 (1 likes)*

**A:** Part 2 will just be wrapping up the install and wiring for power.

Still researching demon eyes, etched lenses, advanced animations etc, so those vids are all in the future once I figure them out.

### Q: Hey did you get the flow series or rgbwa? Planning doing this soon. Great vid bro 👍🏼
*Asked by @kevinruiz1432 (0 likes)*

**A:** Flow series. Thanks man!
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Hey bro thank you so much for the video. Just a question so you used back the same glue and did you use the same method as in 275 heat and wait 7 minutes again to glue it back together?
*Asked by @markovalenzuela3315 (1 likes)*

**A:** Yessir. Exact same sequence in reverse.  I've done this a handful of times and never needed to use new sealant - never had moisture issues or anything.  Just make sure it gets warm enough so you can seal it just as tight as it was before.  (YMMV, I'm def not a pro!!)

### Q: You didnt use the halos?
*Asked by @moktarmalik1174 (1 likes)*

**A:** Nah wasn't the look I was going for 🤙🏽
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Can i buy these for my q60?🤔
*Asked by @Younggp98 (1 likes)*

**A:** Technically, yes. But I'm not sure how well they'd fit as the kit is definitely q50 specific. I think y'all's eyebrows are way longer than the Q50s, and u don't have crescents
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Waiting for the parts to get in so I can do this. Question tho, how did you put the headlight housing back together? Did you back them again to soften the material it has and put the screw back in? Or did you use new glue material and reapplied it? Or no glue at all?
*Asked by @joseostorva7235 (2 likes)*

**A:** So I've done this a handful of times now, and I've never had a moisture/condensation issue.

MOST of the time, I just reuse the butyl sealant that was on the headlight. Once the build is done, I put the lens back on as tight as I can by hand, then put it back in the oven to warm up the sealant. I pull it out and immediately screw everything back tight.

I've replaced the butyl sealant once. Not necessary in my opinion unless you're extra paranoid. Be sure to remove all the old stuff before putting new stuff down, or it gets messy. 

Good luck Jose!! 🙌🏾🙌🏾🙌🏾

### Q: Anyone know how to get the “frosted” brow and crest look?
*Asked by @jdfalcon5375 (0 likes)*

**A:** Light sandblasting or several coats of rattle can frost spray on the smooth side
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Do you know if this kit will work with aftermarket headlights?
*Asked by @johnnydiep6622 (0 likes)*

**A:** Can't think of any reason why it wouldn't; it just might need to be manipulated a bit to fit if the headlight design is different
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: How much you charge? I would just rather you do it for me.
*Asked by @smilejoe8736 (1 likes)*

**A:** I don't do custom builds at this time.  Maybe soon though!
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Did you paint it satin ?
*Asked by @Awsometiger1011 (1 likes)*

**A:** Yeah i painted most of the stuff flat/matte black, with the exception of the shroud, which I did in gloss black
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: I wanna do this so bad. What’s the damage i’m looking at? $$$$?   WOAH and hold up where are you jacking it up from ???
*Asked by @brandonracioppi3607 (0 likes)*

**A:** All said and done about 700 in parts for a full setup with welcome animations, demon eyes, etc. Check out Parts 2 and 3, I went IN on these and I'm not done 😳

I usually jack the car at the front crossmember and rear diff and then put it on stands all 4 corners. Is that weird? 😅
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: did you find another option for  the purchase of the leds other than lighting trendz?
*Asked by @jorgel673 (1 likes)*

**A:** YES Details coming soon.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Hey bro really hope this is my last question. So I’ve got the first headlight completed. Painted, upgraded drls, projector etched lense, demon eyes etc. what do I do with all these new wires hanging out the back of the headlight before I bake the headlight again to seal it back together? Kinda leery
*Asked by @feta8939 (1 likes)*

**A:** I tuck ALL the wires into the headlight before I bake them.  Then I ran the wires out and drilled a hole for them in the little cap thing. Check out my video 3!!! Ur almost there homie 👊👊👊
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Does the kit bring the eyebrows as well bro?
*Asked by @JoseAmaya-ql7bv (1 likes)*

**A:** Yup eyebrows and crescents and optional halo rings too. Use coupon code SQUAREWHEELS at checkout for a discount!
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: What the name of the app to connect?
*Asked by @rajaewebb60 (0 likes)*

**A:** The app for this controller is called LED HUE
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Hey bro so quick question?? When you put those new components on, do you take the OEM drl boards off completely, or you put them back over the flow series parts! I’m really confused on how this works since q50 drl boards turn on automatically if I’m not wrong, so do they need to be turned on manuall
*Asked by @MsFenix89 (1 likes)*

**A:** These parts replace the OEM DRL stuff.  Check part 3 for wiring/welcome animation, etc
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Located?
*Asked by @Hitch_49 (0 likes)*

**A:** I'm in greater Atlanta area. But I don't work on other people's cars!
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: what all options did  you pick??? i’m about to order mine but i want mine to come out like yours! do i need a halo/ diffuser?
*Asked by @cristianfranco7658 (0 likes)*

**A:** I picked their flow series and ended up using a blueghozt plus controller instead of the crappy one that comes with flow series.  I bought the halos and ended up not using them.  

TBH there's better options out there than lightingtrendz - they're overpriced, often botch orders, and their support sucks.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Been following your moves with my Q, I got my Tesla mark 5 installed loving it, however I ordered my kit from Lightningtrendz and They Sent everything but the Eyebrow LED was that something additional on top of the kit? Because I ordered the exact same thing
*Asked by @GriptheGlick (0 likes)*

**A:** Thx for the support!!! Yeah man the eyebrows supposed to come with the kit but honestly lightingtrendz has gotten something wrong with literally EVERY delivery theyve sent me 😓

May want to wait for my next video too. Make sure you're getting the blueghozt controller not lightingtrendz, it's so much better.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Am I able to use profile pivot switchback lights instead of the lightingtrendz? I saw on a forum a guy used pivot switchbacks for the eyebrow (24in) and the half moon(9in). What size strip did you use for your eyebrows?
*Asked by @Mk8boosted (0 likes)*

**A:** Yeah man once u get in there I can put whatever u want! 24" eyebrows and 8 3/4" crescents
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Hey man good review. I have a question can i just buy the sp110e on Amazon for $10 instead of adding a Bluetooth controller to my lightingtrendz cart? Cuz that makes a 70 dollar difference. Unless there's some other pieces are supposed to come with it.
*Asked by @4uenvycustomsleds321 (0 likes)*

**A:** Good question man - no other pieces come with the LightingTrendz controller - I'd give the AMZ one a shot if I could do it again.   On my install, nothing goes to the power supply on the BT controller.  Just a single connection from the Lightingtrendz control module to the SP110e.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Can I use a hear gun instead of baking?
*Asked by @enochkoech94 (1 likes)*

**A:** Certainly can! Might be a bit more challenging to keep the sealant warm all the way around, but I've definitely heard people doing it
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Why didn’t you use the halo rings?
*Asked by @txq50s41 (0 likes)*

**A:** They looked a bit too flashy for my taste
