### Q: Which wire taps the turn signal? And which taps the DRL 😭
*Asked by @braddahalladin8697 (3 likes)*

**A:** This kit didn't come with turn signal switchbacks or drl taps. It's just ON when car is on or OFF when car is off. I'll be getting a different controller that enables switchbacks and other stuff when car is off

### Q: I am going to start this project right when I get back from vacation. However I am using profile pivot led switchbacks, so I do not need a controller but is there any way you can help or suggest a way to wire as a DRL and turn signal?? Thanks
*Asked by @swmfpv (1 likes)*

**A:** No idea!  I'd say follow the instructions that come with the switchbacks - I'm surprised they don't come with a controller?

### Q: Oh I forgot to ask how did you put the clear casing back on? What adhesive did you use?
*Asked by @Awsometiger1011 (0 likes)*

**A:** I just reversed the process. Put the clear casing on after everything is assembled, warm up in the oven, then squeeze together while the sealant is warm and put the screws back in

### Q: Regarding your power source… are you able to leave them on in the app and they turn on when you start the car or do you have to turn them on using the app?
*Asked by @bryanmatthews5827 (1 likes)*

**A:** Can be done either way. Check out videos 2 and 3 for more power source options. I've now got my blueghozt running always-on so it can do welcome animations when I unlock the doors 👍🏾

### Q: Hey man how did you connect the lighting trendz power wire into the fuse panel? I’ve got my headlights apart and painted so installing the new leds is my next step
*Asked by @feta8939 (1 likes)*

**A:** Awesome I love to hear when ppl are doing this! check out this video @ 5:04 - this is where I tapped for switched 12v for the Lightingtrendz controller.

### Q: I have a 2018 and my fuse box has a second smaller box, it has the same little black one as you but then it has a blue one next to it, do i continue and wire it up like yours or?
*Asked by @mistros5684 (1 likes)*

**A:** The position I noted was one of few that provides switched 12v power when the engine is on.  Should be the same for all years but if you're in doubt, check with a multimeter!

### Q: On the dash does anything come up about the drls? Or does it stay totally fine? The drl on my driver side died and if this doesnt show any issues with drls being unplugged, heck im gonna do exactly this!
*Asked by @apperez2406 (1 likes)*

**A:** No issues or errors!! 👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Will the lights turn on when you unlock the car at night like before?
*Asked by @Mk8boosted (1 likes)*

**A:** Depends how u wire it and what controller u use. Watch part 3 if you’re interested in unlock animations.
