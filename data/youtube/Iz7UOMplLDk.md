### Introduction ([0:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz7UOMplLDk&t=0s))

welcome please verify gug operation prior to driving thank [Applause] [Music] you I know it's been a minute I know I've been quiet I know I haven't answered a lot of y'all's questions when you see the sneak peeks in the reals and in the stories and on the Tik Tok I really can't speak on a lot of this stuff until it's official and confirmed and I've touched it and felt it and experienced it with my own hands but that time is here Apex is here my name is Rob at Square Wheels Auto and it's my job to bring you the best in aftermarket for our vehicles I've been painfully aware that there's a wide open space just begging for Innovation and that is in our dashboards when we look left and we look right at all the other competitors we see them offering nice fully functional digital dashboards even Nissan has implemented these digital dashes in the new Z and even some of the economy Vehicles I'm pretty sure that the new Pathfinder um has a digital dash also they still don't seem to be paying very much attention to the Q50 and the Q60 despite the fact that we've got a huge audience of enthusiasts that relentlessly support the brand I've got a solution for you I've got a solution for us the Apex Digital dashboard is here the Apex Digital dashboard is completely designed from the groundup available now Square Wheels auto.com today I'm going to give you the full overview I'm going to go through

### Configuration ([1:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz7UOMplLDk&t=107s))

all the menus show you how it's operated I'm going to show you the features including the interactivity with the second generation of G Series screens aka the Mark 7 any questions anything that I miss or anything that I don't cover please feel free to hit me down in the comments I'm here to help I want to help y'all make informed decisions as you continue evolving your vehicle to what you know that it can be stay tuned Apex is here all right first and foremost let's start with what I call the boring stuff right obviously we know that the OEM display is getting replaced with a beautiful bright OLED display it's bright it's clear it's super responsive it gives you all the visuals that make the old dials just look ancient so the system is built to be faster and actually more responsive than the OEM system what most of you all want to know um right out of the gates is compatibility and functionality with the car um please to report after tons of

### Testing ([2:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz7UOMplLDk&t=176s))

testing tons of testing with vehicles in the US Apex XEX cluster is fully compatible with all the OEM functions for all the models that we offer it for and we're not going to release it until we've got full compatibility with your model so right now I think 2014 2017 full compatibility 2020 plus uh we're going to have full compatibility soon and sign up on the website to get an email when they come open but just rest assured speedometer odometer mileage sync all your lanee keep and sensor notifications your drive mode selector basically anything that um the OEM cluster did the Apex cluster will do uh better more Moder sexier better interface speaking of interface uh the Apex cluster also comes prepackaged with configurable themes uh so it's not just about you know the same picture on a digital dash now you've got themes that you can choose from uh to customize your display just based on your mood or your driving style you can change it about any time it's you know

### CarPlay/Android Auto ([4:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz7UOMplLDk&t=240s))

kind of like a theme for your your phone if you will there's a couple themes anywhere from like a Sleek minimalistic design to like a race inspired look um plus you get features like I'll go into the features but most of the themes have like a shift or a Redline indicator and you can even display navigation directly on the display now here are the outbox themes that come available uh when this product launches there will be more themes coming and when they do come out they'll be listed on Square Wheels auto.com for square Wheels Auto customers to be able to download as a part of the firmware I think the next one up in line is the GTR style uh theme and that'll kind of mimic the look and feel of an oem GTR dashboard so really cool looking forward to that one now with all this additional functionality and all this configurability a common question is well how do I how do I operate it is is it laborious to go through the menus uh I can say firsthand is just my opinion no I think they did a really good job making it a slick interface basically

### Configuration ([5:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz7UOMplLDk&t=308s))

you go through all the menus with the left and the right screen button the same way you would on your OEM display and uh some of the features use the okay button to kind of toggle into the menus um I'll show you that here but it's really just two or three buttons you cycle through about seven menu screens and here I'll show you the different screens that are available to you but what about the installation where can I take it to get

### Installation ([6:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz7UOMplLDk&t=370s))

installed y'all I'll cover it in a separate video it'll probably be like a 3 minute video but let's be honest I do Babble a lot so it'll probably be like a 10-minute video but the installation is super simple it basically comes down to two screws and two plugs which is basically the same way that the OEM dashboard is installed and then there's like a bonus of two plugs for USB cable for updates and an HDMI in cable which I'll discuss in a little bit that's it two plugs two screws and then two bonus plugs but they all plug in you can't plug anything in the wrong spot it's impossible to ruin anything like really easy y'all if y'all can install a dash cam y'all can install the Apex cluster yes carplay is on the Apex unit uh what you'll notice is that my garage is completely empty there is no Q50 in there and that is because my car is hurling towards Las Vegas right now to be in the SEMA show yes that is right for the second year in a row Square wheels will be at SEMA in the Au car booth and this year my car will be the demo vehicle I'm telling you all that to say unfortunately I was unable to film

### CarPlay/Android Auto ([7:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz7UOMplLDk&t=450s))

the carplay section of this video and really demo that capability but it works just like carplay Works um you literally just hook your phone up through Bluetooth to the Apex unit and carplay flips itself on each time you start the car this is a great option to add carplay to a vehicle that doesn't have carplay um doesn't have an aftermarket head unit now you can just install the Apex cluster and you've got carplay either window within the theme or you can also display it full screen like you can with any of the other HDMI inputs so great option unfortunately I couldn't demo it I'll do some shorts or some reals uh hit me up in the comments if you want to see it firsthand before you uh get your hands on it oh man y'all so this this feature right here is what really has me excited about the Apex cluster by adding one little HDMI port the team changed this from being like a cool Gadget that modernizes and elevates your interior to something that can completely transform your entire Driving Experience from infotainment to Performance monitoring the opportunities are endless so originally I think the HDMI port was to be used for uh display navigations from the Mark 7 um which would then open you up to being able to display something else on the Mark 7 so you have your turn by turn um directions on the Apex cluster you can play a movie or the game or your music or whatever else on the Mark 7 uh so here's how it works so when the Mark 7 detects a device on the other end of that HDMI cable an HDMI button pops up on the Mark 7 screen to indicate that it's sending a signal over uh by default it'll be sending a mirror of the screen which you'll be able to see on the Apex cluster you know in that window uh in your theme but by pressing that HDMI button it will start treating the Apex as a second screen so whatever app has focus on the Mark 7 will now move over to the Apex cluster and display in full screen um which again opens you up to use the Mark 7 for whatever you want now obviously great for maps and navigation but the cool thing about this is that that HDMI button on the Mark 7 supports

### Installation ([10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz7UOMplLDk&t=605s))

any app any app that you can install on your Mark 7 from the Android play store whether it be performance and tuning like uh eutc jb4 any of them uh draggy um or multimedia uh VLC Netflix uh any of these video players all of them can be used on the Mark 7 and ported it over to the Apex cluster so it opens you up to a world of opportunities just with that pairing between the Mark 7 and the Apex cluster now another common question that I get is do I need a Mark 7 for the Apex cluster to work and the answer is definitively no so the Apex cluster think of it as an independent device and what that means is that once you hook it up it'll read all the commands from your vehicle and display them just like your OEM uh dashboard would do and then it has some additional

### CarPlay/Android Auto ([11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz7UOMplLDk&t=668s))

bells and whistles at the carplay um and the configurable themes now as I mentioned pairing it with a Mark 7 definitely opens up a whole world of different opportunity but let me be clear the Mark 7 is not required for the Apex cluster to work um I am really curious if the HDMI port on the Apex cluster is just like a dumb port and it's just going to display anything that get sent to it or if it's actually looking for a signal from the Mark 7 I suspect that it is just a dumb HDMI input which would mean you could hook up a Raspberry Pi or chomecast or Fire TV or any other device that sends um HDMI output to the Apex poster uh if you do this and try it out please hit me up in the comments or tag me on IG or something I would love to see how y'all are using the Apex cluster and really extending its uh capabilities so another idea I've been toying around with is getting a night vision like an infrared

### Camera Setup ([12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz7UOMplLDk&t=734s))

camera mounting it somewhere stealth on my front bumper and then routing it through to push that video signal over to the Apex cluster that would mean that in addition to looking out my windshield and seeing anything that my headlights you know bathe light on I'll also have night vision in full screen on my Apex display just in case you know there's a deer out of line of my headlights or anything that I wouldn't see with my natural eye now I will have a second chance to be able to avoid it um with the night vision camera just an idea I haven't done anything with it yet if y'all beat me to the punch please post it up and and tag me um got some other ideas floating around but I want to make sure I get this out there to y'all I know there's a handful of y'all waiting for this information so here it is go get your own and tag me in your in your content let me know what you're doing with yours y'all I think that's it um so I think I got everything out of my head into the video but obviously if I did miss anything please don't hesitate blow up the comments I will be monitoring and responding to your your comments individually in line uh those questions that do get a lot of likes or cosign I will shout you out in a video response on shorts or reals or wherever you're watching this but no matter what don't hesitate to ask cuz all I want is for y'all to be fully informed so that you can decide if Apex is uh for you I already have my opinion I I love mine I now see it as the centerpiece of my uh interior anyway as mentioned Q units are available on Square Wheels auto.com 2014 2019 Q50 and Q60 out now 2020 plus coming soon sorry Brad no hybrid support I don't think it's ever coming um more models after that G37 is next 370Z and GTR all of them are done with

### Testing ([14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iz7UOMplLDk&t=855s))

manufacturing and in final testing uh any models that I'm aware of that I've got visibility to the testing I already have them listed up on Square Wheels auto.com with signup forms so just fill it out and I'll email you or text you whenever they're ready for prime time that's it Apex is here this is Robert Square wheel signing off appreciate you
