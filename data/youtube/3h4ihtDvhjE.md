### Introduction ([0:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h4ihtDvhjE&t=1s))

what's going on y'all Rob here Square Wheels Auto I'm back I told you I was coming back y'all if you haven't seen it Apex cluster is here check out the overview video link it somewhere up here somewhere down there depending on where you're watching but this right here is going to be the installation video I'm going to walk you through it step by step in a nutshell it's basically two screws and two plugs and you're on your way but of course I'll walk through it in painstaking detail because I know y'all appreciate having that transparency up front as always any comments any questions any concerns anything I may have missed in this video always hit me up in the comments always hit me up on support I'm here for you I want to make sure youall are enjoying these things as much as I do sit tight we're going to walk through this it's dead easy now the first step in the installation is going to be to take a deep breath and relax realize that the instrument cluster is probably one of the most basic most uncomplicated components of our vehicles it's 99% readon meaning it's only there to read values from the vehicle and present them to you as a user there's very little that's coming from the dash and going into the computer so you don't need to worry about breaking anything or throwing any lights or anything like that it's a a a dumb terminal just the same way that your TV has nothing to do with your Xbox or your PlayStation you can punch a hole in your TV and your Xbox will be just fine it's the same concept take a deep breath relax you're not going to break anything ready to move on to step

### Removal ([1:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h4ihtDvhjE&t=101s))

two now to remove your OEM instrument cluster I I went through tons of videos on YouTube I went through tons of um I don't know documents that said you have to take apart your entire dashboard and pull all this stuff apart I didn't run into that I talked to my homely who does tons of custom work on q50s it's really easy this guy says that he's changed out instrument clusters uh while he was driving which I don't recommend disclaimer fine print fine text and all that I don't recommend that just know that it's not terribly difficult just pull forward on the uh fascia above the instrument cluster and it'll pop out there's just three tabs on there you can pull that out and then there's like a little leather uh fascia cover that kind of covers your steering column there's three plugs on that all you got to do is pull it out you're not going to snap anything I promise you pull it out and you'll expose the fascia for the OEM instrument cluster now keep in mind

### Wiring ([2:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h4ihtDvhjE&t=166s))

there's a plug for your starter button and then there's a plug for your lightness controls on the uh left what I've been doing is leaving the start button connected and then just flipping the fascia over to the side so I can can operate pull things out put things in there's plenty of room to do it so first step is pull the plastic fascia out and that will expose the OEM cluster after you've got the face out you will see that there's two uh two screws at the very bottom just simple Phillips head screws you remove those Phillips head screws and you'll be able to pull the fascia directly out towards you and it's just held in you'll see it once you get it out it's held in by those two plastic CR pins that they use for everything and once you've got it out you'll see that there's only two screw or two plugs on the back of the OEM instrument cluster I don't know what they do they just talk to the instrument cluster and give it power that's all you need to know you

### Removal ([3:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h4ihtDvhjE&t=227s))

remove those two plugs and your instrument cluster is free in your hand to throw in the trash now once you got the OEM cluster out you're ready to perform your mileage SN so go ahead and take that OEM cluster out of the trash bring it back you're not done with it yet now to explain the mileage syn I think it's kind of helpful just to understand how it works so I'm going to break it down think of the cable that comes in the kit um as a glorified I don't know sync cable and the way the sync cable will work is is to basically get power from the vehicle as its input and then it'll treat the OEM cluster as a host and it will tell the Apex cluster to read from the host and write its mileage to the Apex cluster so as you can see here I've got the Apex cluster over here I've got the OEM cluster right here I've got my mileage Sy Cable in hand now if you look up

### Removal ([5:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h4ihtDvhjE&t=303s))

here since I removed the OEM cluster I've got two wires and they're coming off the exact same harness there's one wide one and one small one this is the sequence that you need to follow in order to perform your mileage sync of course make sure that your car is completely off not in accessory mode not in ignition mode but completely off step one is going to be take this wide plug and plug it in to the back of the Apex cluster and as you can see there's no where to plug it in the wrong spot there's just one big port and one small Port you're going to plug the wide side into the Apex cluster then the other one will be free make sure that this is still accessible and what you're going to do

### Wiring ([6:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h4ihtDvhjE&t=367s))

is take your trusty mileage sink harness and take the female end of it plug it into the nail end of this plug here no way to plug it in wrong right what you're left with is the two input ends is what I'm going to call them the next step in the process will be to plug the first plug and they're exactly the same they don't matter it's just about the sequence but you're going to plug the first one into the other hole on the back of the Apex cluster right here again can't get in the wrong spot and then the last step will be to plug in this last plug from the maret carness into to the back of the OEM cluster here once you do that both of the Clusters will light up and you should see the mileage the matching mileage from your OEM cluster show up on your Apex cluster now I'm not doing it because I've already done the mileage sync and I don't want to you know kind of resync the mileage so um oh yeah another thing while you have

### Wiring ([7:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h4ihtDvhjE&t=450s))

the um mileage SN harness installed you can and probably will see a chassis control system error on either the Apex cluster or the OEM cluster that's fine it's perfectly normal it'll go away once you remove the mileage syn cable and you just install the cluster as it is but basically you'll see here my mileage is already synced and uh updated so now I know that I can just complete my install remove the mileage syn harness and then plug that other plug right into the back of the Apex plug in your OEM or sorry plug in your USB and your HDMI and then button it up and you will be ready to go so I've already gotten a head start I have kind of taken apart my center console uh enough to get to the back of the Mark 7 screen now currently in 2024 the Mark 7

### Testing ([8:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h4ihtDvhjE&t=513s))

is the latest generation of Tesla style screens for the Infinity Q50 Q60 there's also Mark 7 equivalent for the G37 370Z Nissan GTR you name it so we're taking the same um core model right the same screen the same processor the same memory and just refactoring it to fit into the dashboards of all these other vehicles so that we can use the same software across the board on all these these devices what I'm doing is pulling the Mark 7 out of its spot one more time uh for this project and the whole reason is because the Apex cluster interfaces with the Mark 7 through an HDMI cable so all I'm doing is plugging the HDMI cable into the back of the screen here so a little rigid rigid rigid a little rigid Edge is out and taking the other end and routing it through this cute little hole here um there's a spot right next to the vent where there's plenty of room um to Route

### Wiring ([9:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h4ihtDvhjE&t=583s))

any wires through so now I've got this cable just hanging out and ready for me to plug in the digital dash from here I can go ahead and replace or receip the screen uh it is a little tight back here with all this stuff just tuck it in as best you can make sure your top screen is seated securely and then this one will fit in place just fine and it's ready for me to screw it back in place here's the USB cable now you're going to want to Route this through probably to uh underneath in your footw and just be able to tuck it you know back here behind this panel you're going to want this to be uh relatively accessible because you're going to plug in uh a thumb drive here for any uh firmware

### Firmware Update ([10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3h4ihtDvhjE&t=646s))

updates so the business end of this goes in this spot right here and the HDMI goes in right here now this USB cable comes with a 90° bend on it so it's not going to be pushing out too far um and it's not going to be getting kinked up behind the digital dash I guess if you could find a 90° HDMI cable um it would be better but uh obviously mine is just straight so uh I'll see how it goes last steps is just going to be the HDMI and the USB that we discussed before you can kind of figure it out just by touch There She Goes seat that back in there hopefully you can see back here it lines up pretty much perfectly it sits back and all you got to do is screw in those exact same screws and then put your facia back on and you are ready to rock and roll
