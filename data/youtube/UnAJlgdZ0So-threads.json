My 350z BOSE audio was instantly ripped out but with the BOSE premium in my Q60 the audio is like pretty decent. So I’m conscious to avoid downgrading audio just for the screen. Cheers",

That&#39;s exactly how it behaves, it piggybacks the AUX. If you have Bose, all the amplifying and sound processing will still be handled downstream.  The MK5 has its own EQ but I leave flat and just let the Bose do it&#39;s thing.  Hope that helps!!",
