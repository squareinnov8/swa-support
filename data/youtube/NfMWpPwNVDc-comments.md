### Q: Can u just splice it instead of running a whole new wire run?
*Asked by @joshuaheredia7965 (1 likes)*

**A:** Plz do and report back. I’ve been curious but never tried myself as it’s not the most plug and play option

### Q: Does this finally work with 360 cams?
*Asked by @LateKnightGamingTV (2 likes)*

**A:** Probably.  Just need someone to confirm after splicing into the OEM backup signal.  I don't have 360 to try it myself.

### Q: Does this work on the OEM system?
*Asked by @XxTrickFlowxX (2 likes)*

**A:** Designed to accompany aftermarket head units. The OEM screen is still tiny and low-res, so benefits will be limited.

### Q: Rob, can I just use the factory wiring for the camera that’s already in there, or do I have to take out the dash and connect the new yellow cable to the MK7?
*Asked by @nickgopic (2 likes)*

**A:** Probably could splice into OEM harness but I haven't tried myself!

### Q: I bought the mk7 and want to keep my OEM backup camera. But on the oem factory head unit I had guiding lines for when I back up and for some reason that was removed when I upgraded to the mk7. How do I get the guidelines back????

### Q: Seriously? do you drive backwards most of the time?  $70 for something i use rarely (I don't parallel park in NYC), is not worth the cost, the time, and the aggravation of disassembly/reassembly.  For people with more money and time than brains.  I love your videos but this is over the top absurd.
