### Q: I just got my 3rd Q50 ,  I never understood why a clock would appear in the top screen on some videos? It's always been my GPS /Map. Not even sure if my top window can show a clock LOL. I guess it's an option. I now understand why some don't like the layout after listening to your comments. I have a

### Q: Got my Q50 back in November, always wanted one, you can say my dream car at 53 years old ! I love it and still trying to learn what it can all do.

*Asked by @royvonalmen5044 (6 likes)*

**A:** Congrats on the Q and thanks for the sub Roy!! Unfortunately I don't there's any way to do what ur looking for other than shutting down both screens. These 2 screen systems look great at a glance but once u actually use them it's clear they weren't well-thought-out 😓

### Q: Hey man, your videos are amazing I love them all, well the ones about q50’s, since I have a red sport. I wanted to ask you a question, does the aucar mark5 work with a WiFi or Bluetooth obd adapter, to see car stats on the screen?
*Asked by @lancerome1976 (4 likes)*

**A:** Hey thanks for watching Lance 🙌🏾

Yeah the MK5 works with (and comes with) a wifi ODB2 adapter that works with torque or any other app.  It doesn't have open Bluetooth, so you can't use a Bluetooth ODB2 adapter, only a wifi one.

*Asked by @allpainnogains4298 (1 likes)*

**A:** I just use my phone as a hotspot and connect the MK5 wifi to it 👍🏾

### Q: I just had the joyeauto one and took it out my car after one day lol. I'll be sure to try this one, does it have wireless android auto?
*Asked by @ThatguyLoso120 (1 likes)*

**A:** Lmao yeah the JA was no bueno.  Unfortunately the Smartautokits is wired AA only. And the USB connection doesnt fast charge. Still 1000% better than joyeauto tho 😅

### Q: On the site they have two option the more expensive model... car you do more with iOS apple play part?
*Asked by @paulnguyen5360 (1 likes)*

**A:** The one in my video is the less expensive model. The more expensive one is more like an android tablet. I’m not sure, but I’d imagine the CarPlay would be quite similar on both.

### Q: Does it fit the 2021 model of the q50?
*Asked by @elijahjones6700 (1 likes)*

**A:** Not sure about that. I know the Q infotainment got upgraded in 2020 to include carplay on the top screens. Check out the website or dm me @veeqfiddy I can get u contact info for seller
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Dang mine is a 2014. 
Anyway to use the top screen to show say google maps or Waze from my phone... Like mirror the screen?
*Asked by @crzellmer (0 likes)*

### Q: Did u install the gps and mic 🎙?

*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Will this work on q50 2021 luxe awd?
*Asked by @kohheart2255 (1 likes)*

**A:** Not sure! Check w/the seller - on the website it says 2015-2019 - I know in 2020 Infiniti started supporting Carplay/Android Auto from the factory ,so you might have a totally different unit in there?
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Am I able to program a short video to play only when it turns on ?
*Asked by @amvpv6774 (0 likes)*

**A:** Don't think so. You can choose a splash screen image that displays on startup (it has INFINITI and GT-R logos as the 2 default options).
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: How do you install this product ?
*Asked by @heemdollas8016 (1 likes)*

**A:** The unit itself sits in the middle under your AV knob. It has wires that run up behind the top screen. Easy install - it's way less scary than it sounds
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: You got anything for the 14 Q50??
*Asked by @yomammahouse (3 likes)*

**A:** Nah but U could get a 15+ screen off eBay and then these piggybacks would work. They're usually under $200.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: how was the install on it?
*Asked by @NeonMotion23 (1 likes)*

**A:** Done in under an hour. Trickiest part was running the wire behind the top screen. Not really hard just gotta follow the instructions to a T!
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Question: which info setup do you like best? Your older or newer one?
*Asked by @klb1718 (1 likes)*

**A:** Man this is a TOUGH question lol. 

I LOVED the smartautokits, mostly for the function it added.  It was also pretty responsive to touch/opening apps/etc.  Downsides: you HAD to plug in your phone for navigation/apps/music/etc which was a hassle, and I didnt like wires always being visible.

The new Tesla screen is a TOTAL visual flex.  It's a conversation piece and it elevates the interior.  My phone provides it wifi, so no wires/waiting for connection - it's ready to go when the car starts up. 
Only downside is I find it a shade less responsive, especially when multitasking. 

In a nutshell, the MK5 Tesla screen wins... but only by a hair.
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: are you connected to hotspot?

*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Nice video bro. I got a 2020 q50 do you happen to know if this will work?
*Asked by @AZIZallcaps (0 likes)*

**A:** Thanks!! The site says 2015-19 so not sure. I know in 2020 Infiniti added carplay to the factory system - not sure if those changes make this system not work??
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: fire vid, why you don't like the joyeauto?
*Asked by @jerryl10000 (0 likes)*

**A:** Thx! I could do a whole video on how bad it was lol. It was so glitchy. It randomly rebooted, Android auto never worked wirelessly, and wired would throw error messages. There was no way to force it to reboot, so it would brick itself and be unusable for days. The seller said the support from the manufacturer was poor and they didn't offer firmware updates. The smartautokits unit is the polar opposite. Clear difference in build quality too.

*— @SquareWheelsAuto*
