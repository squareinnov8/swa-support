### Q: Hay there, this video and all the others inspired me to start a underglow project. 

The only thing that I don’t follow is this.
The underglow start-up animation when you unlock/ open you car. 
Is this the BlueGhozt that triggers the SP602E where all the strips are connected to?

Thanks in advance!

*Asked by @vincentruisaard1847 (1 likes)*

**A:** Hey Vincent! Yeah it's the blueghozt that enables the welcome animations. There's a couple ways to do it but easiest way is to ditch the 602 and just use the blueghozt  to control it all

### Q: Does this drain the battery with all these wires ?
*Asked by @Awsometiger1011 (1 likes)*

**A:** Not if you wire smart! Addressable LEDs can drain your battery even when they're off thiugh. Check out @17:27 I cover the power delivery options and how I did it. U could be fine with just underglow, but with all the heavy lighting I'm running I had to be smart about it 👍🏾👍🏾

*Asked by @Joseph_Prince_Pena (1 likes)*

**A:** Sounds like you've got your work cut out for you!! I feel you, the work is never done 😅😓

Check out some of my other videos, I've done some of those same mods and covered the DIY, with product links AND coupon codes.

To answer your question, I don't really do installs on other people's cars, I'm just a DIY guy that tries to demystify some of this stuff for others as I learn.

Thx for watching man 😎👍🏾

Would you be willing to get with me and let me know a few things with the setup? I want it right and her to be happy. Thank you much, ho

### Q: Can I ask a question if your only running 2 channels why did you plug in 3 signal wires ?
*Asked by @daltonmohr9327 (1 likes)*

**A:** Good eye man 🧐😅

On the 3rd channel, I have extra lights in the grille that I didn't mention, since they don't come with the standard Q50 kit
*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: question.. when you plug in the lights does the blue ghozt app automatically see the lights? or do you have to do something else to make them connect to your phone?
*Asked by @prestonsmith1045 (0 likes)*

**A:** not sure I understand the question.  if the lights are wired to the blueghozt, then it sees them.  to connect the blueghozt to your phone, open the blueghozt app and the name of your blueghozt should pop up.  click it, and you'll be in the interface to control the lights connected to that ghozt.

### Q: Is it possible to program and have underbody lights automatically turn on/off as welcome lights? Like how when the car is park and you unlock from the fob, the door handles have lights that turn on and then turn off. I'm thinking of adding under lights to that sync.

*— @SquareWheelsAuto*

### Q: Question… I did notice you said it activates with the welcome lights. But can it be turned on and off on the fly?

Another thing I was hoping to see was the illumination match the rest of the car. Can’t tell if that’s the cool white or some sort of purplish blue that is showed in the video.
*Asked by @AnthonyRodriguez-hq7px (1 likes)*

**A:** Yeah since this is one of my Blueghozt outputs, I can turn it on and off easily in the app. 👍🏾

I hear you re: white. Because these are RGB strips, they max out their Red, Green, and Blue LEDs to simulate white. Additionally, if the strips end up mounted at an angle, it can affect the way it blends the colors together and you can get a tinted look.  In a nutshell, simulating pure white is tricky.
