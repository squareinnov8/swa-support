**A:** These things benefit from periodic reboots just like phones and computers.  Hold down the physical home button for like 10s to force a reboot and you should be back up and running.

### Q: Has anyone added a sim card to their unit?  If so, does the unit's internet and phone run off that directly?
*Asked by @jasonsergott5823 (2 likes)*

### Q: Hello, i have a question about the mark 6 screen, is it working without problems on a infiniti Q50 S (2) 3.5 V6 306 Ch HYBRID SPORT TECH RWD 7AT from 2013 because on the website it is saying « 2014-2019 »? Thank you very much :)

### Q: I am getting immediate error 
error/1

Engine error: null/28

### Q: do you need internet to use navigation?
*Asked by @HeatForum (0 likes)*

**A:** It’s a full android tablet, so if you want navigation with offline maps, you’d just need to install an app that does that. Pretty sure Google maps supports it. 

Just sucks because you’d miss out on all the real-time traffic reroutes, incident reports, and of course “police/speed trap reported ahead”

*Asked by @LeslyC25 (0 likes)*

### Q: Are yall working on a mk 7? 👀 Im curious to see android 13 run on it, thanks for the great content, also the music is dope!
*Asked by @professor_goodfeels (1 likes)*

**A:** Not to my knowledge, especially considering 13 just launched a couple months ago. Generally, integrated products like these are built on stable/final versions of operating systems to eliminate one of many variables that can affect reliability.

What about android 13 makes it appealing?

Thx for watching!! 🙏🏽🙏🏽
