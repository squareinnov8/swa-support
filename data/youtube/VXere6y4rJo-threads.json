When I play music through my AM, FM or XM Radio it plays fine.  When I play a YouTube video it plays fine but without music or sound. When I go back to the screen to check my input selection it has automatically moved it to the AUX setting. Does the Mark 6 have an AUX out plug somewhere on it that I can plug into my AUX in on my Infiniti Q50? If it does, will you please send me a photo of where it is located on the Mark 6? I believe that will make it work correctly. If you of any other way to get this to work I would appreciate it. Thanks Robert",
